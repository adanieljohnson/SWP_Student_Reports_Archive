Title: The Effect of pH on the Rate of Photosynthesis in Kale Leaves

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment was to measure the effect acidic (pH 4) and basic (pH 10) conditions have on the rate of photosynthesis in Kale leaves. This was done by measuring the reduction of DCIP in the Hills reaction; DCIP an oxidized blue compound and DCIPH2 a colorless reduced compound. Due to the color change during reduction, DCIP can be measured as a decrease of light at absorbance at 600nm using a spectrophotometer. During the experiment, the rich chloroplasts of Kale leaves were isolated using a centrifuge, DCIP and different pH solutions were added to the chloroplast’s mixture, and the absorbances at different pH levels were measured. Two two-sample one tailed t_test measuring the statistical significance in the decreasing direction between pH 4 and pH 6.5 and one between pH 10 and pH 6.5 were conducted. Both one-tailed t_tests showed that there was no statistical significance between the controll and both experimental groups. From the data collected, the experiment highlights that the chloroplasts placed in different pH environments showed no significent difference in their photosynthetic rates. In turn, showing that the DCIP method used, electron acceptor used to measure photosynthetic rate, was not affective. 

Introduction:
In the experiment Brassica O’leracea, Kale, is the plant used to study the effect different levels of pH has on the rate of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the way plants, protists, and bacteria use sunlight to capture and store energy from carbon dioxide and water [Johnson: 2016]. Photosynthesis is divided into light dependent and light independent reactions. For this experiment, the light dependent reaction is studied, specifically, photosystem II and photosystem I. The first system of the light dependent reaction is photosystem II where light causes electrons to leave the chlorophyll and move to the plastoquinone, a copper-containing protein electron carrier [Johnson: 2016]. The oxidized chlorophyll causes the cleavage of water molecules to produce oxygen and more electrons, replacing the ones lost due to chlorophyll. Afterwards, H+ ions from water are pumped into the thylakoid membrane. Reduced plastoquinone, then transfers its electrons to another protein carrier cytochrome b6f. Both of these electron carriers pump electrons into the thylakoid membrane contributing to the proton gradient needed to produce ATP [Johnson: 2016]. The second system is photosystem I, where excited electrons leave the chlorophyll and travel to NADP+ in order to produce NADPH, the reduced form of NADP+ [Johnson: 2016]. The high energy electrons that are stored in NADPH produced in photosystem I and the H+ gradient produced in photosystem II aids the production of ATP and glucose in the light dependent reaction [Johnson: 2016]. In this lab, the rate of photosynthesis will be measured on the reduction of DCIP to DCIPH2 using the Hill reaction. DCIP acts as a substitute to the final electron carrier of photosynthesis NADP+. The reason why NADP+ is not used is because it is harder to measure its absorbance. DCIP is an oxidized blue compound, while DCIPH2 is a colorless reduced compound. Due to the color change, DCIP can be measured as a decrease of light at absorbance 600nm [Johnson: 2016].


Recent research suggests that low pH levels have a strong negative effect on the rate of photosynthesis on plants. Specifically, low pH may decrease the leaf’s ability to absorb CO2 because it damages the photosynthetic electron chain during photosystem I and II [Long: 2017]. Damaging the electron transport chain will obstruct excited electrons from leaving the chlorophyll during photosystem I. In this experiment, this would mean that the Hill reaction will be inhibited as there will not be a sufficient number of electrons leaving the chlorophyll to travel to reduce DCIP. In addition, at both low and high pH levels, the reduction of DCIP is low, yielding a slower rate of photosynthesis, measured by the reaction velocity of DCIP reduction [Hitoshi: 2015]. This is due to the fact that high and low pH levels completely inhibit the Hill reaction. The Hill reaction will be repressed due to the inhibition of oxygen evolution in chloroplast in high and low pH environments [Ikehara: 1970]. The main site of inhibition is the oxidation of water in the Hill Reaction. Without oxidizing water DCIP will not be reduced as H2O would need to be oxidized to complete the oxidation reduction reaction in the Hill reaction. The rate of photosynthesis, measured by the reduction of DCIP in the hill reaction, is decreased in both acidic conditions (pH 4) and basic condition (pH 10) due to inability to properly reduce DCIP in acidic and basic environments. 


Materials and Method:
Conducting this experiment, first chloroplasts had to be abstracted from Kale leaves. After grinding three separate leaves without their central veins with a mortar and pestle, 10 Ml of pH 8 grinding buffer was added, and the leaves were grinded into a thick paste. Then 10 additional Ml of grinding buffer was added, and the solution was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. The solution was transferred into a 50 Ml centrifuge tube and spun at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4ºC in a centrifuge. Afterwards, the supernatant was poured out into a second 50 Ml centrifuge and centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4ºC. The pellet found in the bottom of the second centrifuge tube was resuspended in 15 Ml of pH 8 grinding buffer. The latest solution was then aliquoted into three 5 Ml volumes in three conical tubes. 6 Ml of pH 4 was added into one tube, 6 Ml of pH 6.5 in another, and in the final tube 6 Ml of pH 10 was added. Afterwards, each tube was centrifuged at 2800 rpm for an additional 10 minutes and each pellet was resuspended in 3 Ml of pH 8 buffer to increase the chloroplast concentration. Then 100 microliters from each of the three centrifuges were transferred using a micropipette into three sections of three test tubes, leaving an extra test tube to serve as the blank, and another two tubes with no chloroplast to serve as negative controll groups, a total of 12 tubes. Subsequently, 6 Ml of water was added to each tube, except 8 Ml for the blank. Then 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP was added to all the tubes except for the blank and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 8.5) was added to all the tubes. Each tube was mixed before adding the chloroplasts and transferring the mixtures to the spectrophotometer cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was banked at 600 nm using the blank cuvette and all the cuvettes absorbances were measured at time zero, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and after 30 minutes, remembering to blank the spectrophotometer in between. Equal variance was used because there was same amount of test replicants for each test group (pH 4, pH 6.5, pH 10). The statistical tests used were two two-sample one tailed t_test measuring the statistical significance in the decreasing direction between pH 4 and pH 6.5 and one between pH 10 and pH 6.5 obtained from the raw data of the absorbances measured. The confidence interval was set to 95% with an alpha set of 0.05. 

Results:
Compared to the change in absorbance in pH 6.5 and pH 10, the pH of 4 had a considerably larger change in absorbance after being present in light for 30 minutes (Fig 1). The average change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in the pH 4 solution after 30 minutes was calculated to be -0.01467 ± 0.01402 nm, while the average change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in the pH 6.5 was -0.004667 ± 0.005033 nm. Lastly, the average change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in the pH 10 was -0.00133 ± 0.0005774 nm. For the pH 10 solution with no chloroplast, that change in absorbance after 30 minutes was 0.002 nm, and for the pH 4 solution with no chloroplast the change in absorbance was -0.001 nm. Two two-sample one-tailed t_tests were performed to test the significance in one direction (decreasing) between the acidic and controll pH and basic and controll pH. Comparing pH 4 and pH 6.5, the results were statistically insignificent (t_stat=1.16335, d.f.=4, P=0.154677). Comparing pH 10 and pH 6.5, the results were also statistically insignificent (t_stat=1.39606, d.f.=4, P= 0.15903).

Discussion:
The results do not support the hypothesis that the rate of photosynthesis would decrease in both an acidic (pH 4) or basic environment (pH of 10). The results from the bar graph depict several general trends that do not support our hypothesis. According to the graph there was a larger absorbance change after 30 minutes for the Chloroplast in Light pH 4 compared to in a pH of 6.5 and 10 (Fig 1.). This rejects our hypothesis as there should have been more absorbance change in the controll group (pH 6.5), which was placed in a neutral environment. A larger absorbance change would mean that more photosynthesis took place within the 30 minutes. The hypothesis was further rejected because the p_values obtained through the one tailed t_test between pH 4 and pH 6.5 and between pH 10 and pH 6.5 were both statistically insignificent. Having a p_value above 0.05 means that the null hypothesis was supported. This means that there was no significent change in the rate of photosynthesis between the controll group (pH 6.5) and experimental groups (pH 4 and pH 8). In addition, both t_stats obtained through the one-tailed t_tests were low. T-stat gives us an idea of if the results are significently different from each other. A large T-stat would have been desired between the experimental groups compared to the controll group during the two sample one tailed t_test. Nevertheless, the negative controll groups testing pH 10 and pH 4 in no chloroplast yielded minor changes in absorbance. This demonstrates that photosynthesis does not occur without chloroplast, the organelle in plants that contains chlorophyll where photosynthesis takes place. The results here were expected as there was minor to no change in absorbance to the solutions with no chloroplast.


Although the results of the experiment were not as expected, this may have been due to the fact that the DCIP method was not affective at measuring photosynthetic rate at different pH environments. Modern research does suggest that pH does affect the rate at which DCIP is reduced to DCIP2. For instance, in a study performed by Dr. Hitoshi he measured the reaction velocity of DCIP reduction at different pH levels. He found that the rate of DCIP reduction was fastest between pH’s 6.8 and 11.7 while any pH below 6.8 or above 11.7 saw drops in the reaction velocity of DCIP reduction [Hitoshi: 2015]. In addition, the more acidic or basic the environment, the less DCIP reduction took place. The goal of the Hill reaction is to reduce DCIP to produce DCIP2; Hitoshi’s experiment highlights that a neutral environment is favored for the production of DCIP2 [Hitoshi: 2015]. A possible reason why our experiment may have not yielded statistically significent results was because our pH’s chosen were not acidic or basic enough. Another study has shown that measuring oxygen evolution with a Clark type oxygen electrode is a viable way of determining rates of photosynthesis. In Dr. Ikehara’s experiment he washed chloroplast with different pH levels. Similarly, to Dr. Hitoshi’s experiment, Dr. Ikehara’s experiment showed that high and low pH levels are not optimum environments for photosynthesis to take place. Dr. Ikehara results showed that the Hill reaction will be repressed due to the inhibition of oxygen evolution in chloroplast at high and low pH’s [Ikehara;1970]. Instead of measuring the Hill reaction using the reduction of DCIP this experiment may have been more successful if the Hill Reaction was measured using the reduction of H2O to produce O2. In conclusion, the results gathered from the experiment do not support our hypothesis that photosynthetic rates on Kale leaves, measured by the reduction of DCIP in the Hill reaction, is affected by acidic and basic environments. The DCIP method used to measure photosynthesis was not affective and measuring oxygen evolution using a Clark type oxygen electrode will be used in a future.
