Title: The Effect of a Fake Fish on the Aggressive Behaviors of Betta Splendens 

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to determine the change in level of aggression in a male betta fish (Betta splendens) when exposed to a fake fish versus a real male betta fish. The male betta fish were exposed to a fake betta fish and had their aggressive behaviors recorded and then to a real male betta fish and had their behaviors recorded and then quatified the data and performed statistical tests. It was hypothesized that there would be a higher level of aggressive behaviors when in the presence of a real male fish than a fake one. The results did not support the hypothesis because there was not a significant difference in level of aggression at all, but there was an overall trend in favor of the hypothesis. 


Introduction:
In this experiment, we are studying betta fish (Betta splendens) and their aggressive behavioral reaction to another male betta fish versus a fake one. Betta fish are a very common small fish in Thailand and react to the presence of other males by changing color and flaring their gills [Johnson: 2018]. Their behavior will be quantitatively determined based on number of times specific behaviors are exhibited. It is hypothesized that the male betta fish will exhibit less aggressive behaviors when in the presence of a fake betta fish as opposed to another male betta fish. 

Materials and Methods:
	A male fish was placed in one chamber of a fish tank and a fake fish in another chamber so they were separated by a glass barrier and an opaque barrier. The opaque barrier in between was then removed and the fish was observed for five minutes while recording a number based on type of behavior/level of aggression and times exhibited. The scale used was a value of one for pelvic fin flicking and pectoral fins erect, a value of two for tail beating and opercula expansion, and a value of three for tail flashing and red mane. The opaque barrier was then put back and the fish was rested for five minutes. Another male fish was placed in the other chamber of the fish tank. The opaque barrier between the two male fishes was removed, leaving just the glass. Then were observed for five minutes while recording aggressive behaviors like before. The opaque barrier was then put back and the fish was rested for five minutes. The above procedure was repeated with three more fish. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to determine the statistical significance of the results.


Results:
There was not a statistically significant difference between the level of aggression towards a fake fish vs a real fish (t-stat=1.62, df=6, p=0.16). The trend of the graph was that the level of aggression was much more towards a real male fish as opposed to a fake fish, but the results were just not significant. 


Discussion:
Based on the data collected, the hypothesis that the male betta fish would react more aggressively to a real male betta fish as opposed to a fake betta fish was not supported. The data did show a trend like the hypothesis predicted, but it was not significant. This most likely occurred because of the small sample size and the presence of outliers in the study. A previous study done by Meliska showed lower amounts of aggressive behavior in male betta fish towards a mirror image of another fish compared to a live fish [Meliska: 1976]. Therefore, it is known that there is a less aggressive response to inanimate fishlike objects compared to a real live fish, which supports the trend seen in our experiment. 
Further research could be done to determine if the trend would become statistically significant if more fish were tested because it is reasonable to have some difference based on different fish. Other research could be done with other aggressive fish to see if they generally have the same trend observed with the betta fish.
