Title: Title: The Impact of Ecdysterone on the Weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of ecdysterone (20E) on the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Based on the fact that the rise and fall of 20E is crucial to signaling the commitment pulse (which informs caterpillars to pupate), our group anticipated that overexposure to 20E would cause the caterpillar to never receive the commitment pulse, thus causing the caterpillar to never pupate and continue eating food. Therefore, we hypothesized that the caterpillar would see an average increase in weight after being exposed to 20E. We split 8 caterpillars into 4 groups. The controll group received food mixed with distilled water, and the treatment group received food mixed with ecdysterone. We measured the weights of each caterpillar every two days, for two weeks, and calculated the average weights over the time period. At the end of the experiment, it was observed that the treatment group saw an average decrease in weight, while the controll group saw an average increase in weight. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported. Rather, we observed that the caterpillars exposed to 20E pupated earlier than the caterpillars not exposed to 20E.  


Introduction:
Many of the moths and caterpillars that we see in our state fall under the Order Lepidoptera. One insect under this order is the Manduca sexta caterpillar [Johnson AD: 2018]. These caterpillars exhibit multiple stages, including molting, that eventually allow their transformation into moths. These different stages allow observers to clearly measure how development is impacted by hormones, such as Ecdysterone. Ecdysterone (20E) is a hormone found in insects, in particular caterpillars, that regulates the timing of molting in caterpillars [Johnson AD: 2018]. While caterpillars are in the 4th larval stage there is a sharp decrease in 20E, followed by a small increase of 20E in the 5th larval stage that initiates the commitment pulse [Johnson AD: 2018]. This commitment pulse signals the caterpillar to pupate [Johnson AD: 2018]. What happens if a caterpillar is exposed to increased amounts of 20E? According to a study completed by NASA, the gradual exposure of Manduca sexta tissues to ecdysteroids may have contributed to an increase in flight-muscle growth [Tischler Me: 1990][Wu M: 1990][Cook P: 1990][Hodsden, S: 1990]. Considering that 20E is a form of ecdysteroid, perhaps it could cause an increase in weight in caterpillars. We hypothesize that as caterpillars are exposed to additional 20E, the average weight of the caterpillars will increase. We hypothesize this because we think that overexposure to 20E will cause the caterpillars to miss the commitment pulse, allowing the caterpillars to continue eating even though they are ready to pupate. Add this to the notion that ecdysteroids may cause increases in muscle mass, and there is clear reason to expect an average increase in weight. 

Materials and Method:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were divided in 2 groups of 4 caterpillars. The first group of caterpillars were designated as the controll group, each caterpillar receiving a standard serving of 10 grams of caterpillar food mixed with 3-10 drops of distilled water. The second group of caterpillars were designated as the treatment group, each caterpillar receiving a modified serving of 10 grams of caterpillar food and 3-10 drops of 20E. After the initial weight was recorded, the weight of each caterpillar was checked every two days. After two weeks, the average difference in weights, from start to finish (or death), was used for hypothesis testing. A one-tailed, two-sample T-test was for statistical procedures with a 0.05 significance value. 

Results:
In our experiment, both groups saw an initial increase in average weight. However, after day 3 the treatment group began to experience a decline in average weight. This trend continued until the conclusion of the experiment. Contrasting this, the controll group saw an increase in average weight for the majority of the experiment. The controll group also saw the largest change in weight from the start of the experiment to the end of the experiment (all of this is best portrayed by Graph 1). Looking at all of the average weights holistically, it can be concluded by looking at graph 2 that the controll group had a higher average weight compared to the treatment group. Statistical testing concluded that the mean of the controll group was significently different than that of the experimental group, with a p_value of 0.0064. This is well below the 0.05 significance cut-off value. 

Discussion:
Based on the decline in average weight of the treatment group, we can conclude that the data did not support our hypothesis that caterpillars exposed to 20E would see an increase in average weight. We observed that the caterpillars in the treatment group pupated earlier than those in the controll group, thus causing the decrease in weight that was recorded for the treatment group. Although it can’t be proven in this experiment, our results hint at the idea that additional 20E may actually cause pupation to occur earlier in caterpillars. This phenomenon was observed by an experiment done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as Manduca sexta tissues were exposed to ecdysterone, and these tissues resembled tissues undergoing “larval-pupal transformation” as well as “pupal-adult transformation.” [Judy K: 1970][Marks E: 1970]. These findings could perhaps be useful in agriculture to limit the growth of pests that wreak havoc on crops that are crucial to the human food system. In our experiment, the only possible source of error would be the mistake of choosing caterpillars at different stages of their larvae stages. Some caterpillars were significently larger (by weight) than other caterpillars, thus perhaps causing pupations to occur earlier or later despite the caterpillar’s exposure to 20E. Therefore, the experiment should be repeated using caterpillars that are almost identical in size and larvae stage to rule out the possibility of age playing a role in pupation. Although no conclusion could be made about the correlation between additional exposure to 20E and the weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars, it is known that this hormone is pertinent in the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Without this hormone, we would not see many (if any) of the beautiful moths and butterflies that we see today
