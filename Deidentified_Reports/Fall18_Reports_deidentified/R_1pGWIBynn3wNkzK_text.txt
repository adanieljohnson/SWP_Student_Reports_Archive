Title: Inhibition and Activation of Protein Kinase A in Physarum Polycephalum

Abstract:
Cell signaling, or any communication between cells that leads to a cellular response, are vital to the growth, development, and survival of all organisms. In this experiment, the effect of activators and inhibitors on signal transduction pathways in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum was observed by recording the growth of physarum toward a food source (oatmeal flakes). The specific pathway that was manipulated in the experiment is the cAMP-mediated pathway which is a part of the G-protein coupled pathway. Protein kinase A is an integral part of this pathway and is also the second messenger that will be inhibited or activated during the lab. Petri dishes were treated with curcumin, an inhibitor, and dibutryl cAMP, an activator, both known to affect protein kinase A in their respective ways. The physarum growth toward the food placed in the petri dishes with the activator and inhibitor will be observed and compared to the controll group to determine the effect of the respective compounds. It is hypothesized that the least amount of growth toward the food source will be seen in the curcumin treated plates and the most amount of growth will be observed in the dibutryl cAMP treated dishes. After 24 hours, the results were inconclusive as no growth was observed in any of the petri di

Introduction:
This lab involves the use and manipulation of signal transduction pathways observed in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. All living organisms require some way to respond to its environment and this process is known as cell signaling. Cell signaling is any communication between cells that leads to a cellular response. Basic cellular activities like development, repair, and nutrient uptake rely on the cell’s ability to perceive and correctly respond to their microenvironment. Communication between cells begin with a ligand attaching to a receptor on the targeted cell. Currently the protein ligand interaction model is used to display this first step as seen in an experiment performed by Wallace, Laskowski and Thornton. Using the LIGPLOT programs, the lab resulted in 2-D representations of the conformational changes that occur when a ligand attaches to an integral protein [Wallace: 1995]. This conformational change leads to the activation of a second messenger that continues to activate other second messengers until it binds to the effector. Once bound, the desired protein or transcription factor is activated and cellular behavior changes in response to the initial stimulus [Block: 1998].
Physarum is a perfect test organism for this experiment due to many reasons. This slime mold, while unicellular, is full of diploid nuclei allowing it to exist as a multinucleate syncytium [Costello:2014]. Further, the large size of the physarum is perfect for observing cell-level processes easily. Physarum moves like a giant amoeba by deploying protoplasmic tubes in search of food and detecting any foreign substances [Costello:2014].  During this time, the cytoplasm streams back and forth through a tubular network allowing for the Physarum to move and respond to its environment [Costello:2014].  As explained, physarum do not use a nervous system or hormones to sense and respond to its environment. Rather, every cellular response to the environment follows one of many cellular signal transduction pathways. While there are many different pathways that result in different cellular responses, often times the type of receptor, second messenger, and effectors are the same, allowing us to organize them into families. The physarum observed is mainly regulated by two families of receptors:  G-protein coupled receptors, and ion-coupled receptors. In contrast to ion-coupled receptors that begin when ions from the external environment diffuse into the cell through the plasma membrane, the specific family this lab will be manipulating is the G-protein coupled receptors. Within this family, there are two major pathways that differ in the type of second messenger used. The first uses inositol triphosphate (IP3) as the second messenger to activate protein kinase C in the IP3-mediated pathway. The second, which this lab will focus on, is the cAMP-mediated pathway that activates the enzyme protein kinase A. In this pathway, the effector enzyme activated by the G-protein is adenylate cyclase which converts ATP into cAMP [Block: 1998].  This pathway is vital for regulating cellular processes like food and nutrient uptake, cell growth, and ion channel conductivity. The pathway stops when the cAMP is broken down by phosphodiesterase. Likewise, inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity often results in the increased production of cAMP.
As stated above, this experiment will focus on the activation and inhibition of protein kinase A. Sevetson’s research on protein kinase A shows that various intracellular cAMP activators, including dibutryl-cAMP, activate and increase protein kinase in rat adipocytes [Sevetson: 1993].  Hasmeda’s research, on the other hand, looks at the inhibition of curcumin on protein kinase and Ca2+ in plant signal transduction pathways [Hasmeda: 1996]. The activator, dibutryl cAMP, and the inhibitor, curcumin, will be added to the environment of a physarum culture. The physarum growth toward the food placed in the petri dishes with the activator and inhibitor will be observed and compared to the controll group tested to determine the effect of the respective compounds. It is hypothesized that the least amount of growth toward the food source will be seen in the curcumin treated plates and the most amount of growth will be observed in the dibutryl cAMP treated dishes.


Materials and Method:
This experiment began by acquiring 9 100 mm petri plates containing 2% agar in water. Using a sharpie, the back of the plates were labeled with names, the date, and a 1cm x 1cm square in the center of the plate. The first 3 plates were labeled “controll”, the next 3 plates were labeled “+ dibutryl cAMP” on the back, and lastly “+ curcumin” was written on the last 3 dishes. All 9 plates were turned over, lid up.  Next, 6 Ml of the 20 Ml dibutryl cAMP solution (1Ml dibutryl cAMP, 19 Ml water) was spread on each of the 3 dishes labeled “+ dibutryl cAMP”,  the same was done for the “+ curcumin” dishes using 6 Ml of the 20 Ml curcumin solution (1Ml curcumin, 19Ml water). The simplest method to treat the agar plates with the correct compound was to first soak a plate in the respective compound for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes have passed, the excess solution was poured off and a kimwipe was used to blot off the remaining few milliliters from the lip of the petri dish. The 3 controll dishes did not need to be manipulated as they served as the positive controll for this experiment. The spatula was sterilized using ethanol and fire, cooled, and then used to cut a 1, 1 cm x 1 cm square into the agar of all 9 water agar plates. Once the block of agar was removed, a 1cm x 1cm block of physarum culture was added to each plate, using proper sterilization techniques during the entire process. Next, 8 oats were added to the plate, 4 on the left 3.5 cm away from the physarum culture in the center, and 4 on the right side the same distance away from the center. The lids of each plate were taped down to hold it in place and all 9 plates were placed into a dark bag and stored in the lab drawer overnight (18-24 hours). Once the time has passed, the 9 plates were removed from the dark bag and the tape was taken off the petri dishes. Using a millimeter ruler, the distance that the slime mold migrated from the initial physarum block in the middle was recorded for both sides and averaged together for each of the 9 plates. After all measurements were recorded, all 9 plates were disposed of in the trash can.


Results:
Since no growth was actually seen in the physarum cultures, there was no data to analyze or interpret as our results were inconclusive. The expected data depicted above would have shown various levels of growth based on the lack or presence of a compound in the petri dishes. The controll should have shown medium growth in both directions toward the 4 oats placed on either side of the physarum block, serving as a reference point to show the normal behavior of physarum growth. The 3 plates treated with the activator dibutryl cAMP should have led to a greater growth than observed in the controll. On the other hand, the 3 plates treated with the inhibitor curcumin should have produced little to no physarum growth toward the food supply. The statistical test that would have been used to show that the results were statistically significent would be a two sample t_test resulting in a p_value of less than 0.05. 


Discussion:
Overall the experiment was not successful. Due to the fact that the physarum culture used showed no signs of growth in any of the 9 petri dishes, our results were inconclusive. There are several possible explanations for the lack of growth observed in the physarum cultures. One possibility that the TA warned about before the experiment began was that the physarum used in this lab was old and fragile. Further, upon closer examination of the physarum culture, mold was detected growing on the bottom of the dish, showing the physarum culture was not very healthy. However, it is possible that not enough physarum was used in the first place as only a 1cm x 1cm block was placed in each of the 9 petri dishes. If the lab was to be done again, a greater sample of physarum should be used to ensure noticeable growth within 18-24 hours. Another possible explanation is that the environmental conditions in the classroom were too harsh for physarum growth. A study conducted by Zhang may provide additional insight to the unexpected results of this experiment. Zhang and his team studied how oxidative stress under dark conditions can negatively impact physarum growth[Zhang:2017].  They did this by putting titanium dioxide particles, a known oxidative stressor, into physarum petri dishes and observed how those particles deactivated the signal transduction pathways of the Physarum necessary for growth and cytoplasmic streaming. Therefore a high oxidative stress environment could have been present in this lab and may have played a role in the lack of physarum growth.
That being said, others studies have given results similar to the expected results explained above. In a study conducted by Hasmeda in 1996, curcumin was seen to inhibit cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, supporting the initial hypothesis of this lab [Hasmeda: 1996]. Further, a 1993 experiment performed by Stevetson, Kong, and Lawrence gave results that also support the hypothesis that dibutryl cAMP will increase Kinase A activity. An increase in intercellular cAMP was observed when dibutryl cAMP was introduced to rat adipocytes [Stevetson: 1993]. As mentioned in the introduction, an increase level of intracellular cAMP will directly increase the activation of protein kinase A, as hypothesized. Additional experiments that could be tested involve manipulating the phototaxis behavior observed in physarum organisms. To do this one should introduce the physarum culture to various amounts of light to see the role it plays on physarum growth toward a food source. Overall this lab can be extended to understand current cancer research being conducted focused on inhibiting cell growth. A recent study looked at how the tumorous cells of osteosarcoma were regulated in their growth and development [Qin:2018]. The researchers used TRIM2, a G-protein coupled receptor inhibitor, that was found to inhibit cell division [Qin:2018]. This study shows how receptors of G-proteins can be used to slow down cancerous cells, which grow at a rapid rate. Since cancer arises from the uncontrolllable division of cells, if a greater understanding of the signal pathways that trigger the uncontrolllable division of cells is obtained, then a possible cure may be found.
