Title: The decrease in agonistic intraspecific behaviors amongst male Betta splendens in the presence and absence of food 

Abstract:
Ethology utilizes ecology, biology and evolution to better understand the physiological purpose of animals’ behavior and the effects of evolution on this behavior. Agonistic intraspecific behaviors are often used by aquatic populations to secure survival and reproductive success. This experiment used Betta splendens to observe aggressive behaviors because they mimic wild populations while on time constraints. The hypothesis of the experiment was that male Betta splendens will act more aggressively in environments with smaller amounts of food compared to those with larger amounts of food. This experiment paired six Betta splendens to form three groups. Each group was observed in an environment with no food (the control), a small amount of food and a large amount of food. Each trial lasted for five minutes, followed by a ten-minute break. Linear regression was used to analyze the data. The results of the experiment were statistically insignificant and did not support the hypothesis (r2=0.333, n=9, df=7, p-value=0.104). However, it was observed that the fish acted more aggressively with no food than with a high amount of food. Animal aggression can be studied to understand the negative implications of pollution on waterways and the rate of survival of marine life in that environment

Introduction:
Ethology is an interdisciplinary field using various fields of science, such as ecology, evolutionary biology and genetics, to better understand animal behavior. Ethology utilizes four main concepts of study: how an animal’s behavior helps them with survival and reproductive success, how that behavior has evolved within the species through natural selection, what causes the animal to display that behavior and how that behavior stagnates or shifts as the animal matures [Manning: 1998]. Agonistic behaviors, or displays of aggression, are used as a mechanism of survival and reproductive success amongst fish populations. Betta splendens, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, are useful in observational laboratory studies because they mimic the behaviors of wild populations and can display agonistic behaviors within time constraints.
 
The intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendens have various levels of aggression depending on the stimulus. For example, if a male Siamese fighting fish encounters another male, he may choose to display broadside movements, such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, or tail flashing to warn off the opponent from the claimed territory [Simpson: 1968]. In the instance that the opponent challenges these behaviors, the male Siamese fighting fish may choose to protrude its branchiostegal membranes in a phenomenon known as the red “mane” [Simpson: 1968]. The red mane is known to be the highest level of aggression amongst Betta splendens before physical contact is made [Simpson: 1968]. Understanding the aggressive behavioral patterns of Betta splendens can be useful in predicting the way that marine life must adapt to changing environments due to human exploitation. As pollutants fill aquatic environments, food, space and partners for sexual reproduction become scarce. Thus, dramatically increasing displays of competitive survival mechanisms. We hypothesize that male Betta splendens will act more aggressively in environments with smaller amounts of food compared to those with larger amounts of food.


Materials and Methods:
The experiment quantified the level of aggression of male Betta splendens by counting the number of times they display a red mane in the presence or absence of food. The experiment used six Betta splendens; pairing them with one another to form three groups. Each group participated in three trials. The first trial was the control of the experiment by which the fish were given no food. The second trial utilized the experimental condition of a small amount of food by which the fish were given about 10 flakes to share between them. In the third trial, each group was given a large amount of food of about 20 flakes to share between each other. Each trial period was five minutes long with a ten-minute break provided after each trial. The researches were prepared to separate the paring from one another during the trial if they made physical contact. The data from this experiment was analyzed through linear regression with a one-tailed p-value.

Results:
The data collected from the experiment showed that the average number of red manes displayed during the control trail of no food was 8.00, while the average number of red manes displayed during both experimental conditions of a small amount of food and a large amount of food was 2.67. The results of this experiment were not statistically significant (r2=0.333, n=9, df=7, p-value=0.104) (Fig. 1). The data of this experiment was analyzed with a linear regression model by which the slope of the line was -2.667 (Fig. 1). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis of this experiment suggested that male Betta splendens will act more aggressively in environments with smaller amounts of food compared to those with larger amounts of food. The results of this experiment, however, did not support the hypothesis. The data had a very low correlation coefficient that did not significantly support the negative slope of the data.

Although the data did not support the hypothesis of the experiment, it does offer an interesting insight into animal behavior and the means of survival. Previously, it was thought that the presence of a small amount of food would elicit instinctive aggressive behaviors within the Siamese fighting fish because the resource is scarce and would trigger the need for the fish to claim the territory. However, amongst all three pairings of fish, the control variable of no food had the highest display of aggression, averaging 8.00 red manes per encounter versus 2.67 red manes displayed in the two experimental conditions. The absence of food within the tank may have contributed to hyper-aggression behaviors of the pairing to claim the territory in the event that a resource, food or a female Siamese fighting fish, was added to the environment [Simpson: 1968]. A 2001 study on male Betta splendens investigated the effects of an audience on intrasexual aggressive communication. The experiment was an observational study that mimicked the environment of wildlife populations. The results found that in the presence of multiple males, there was no significant change in the way the males displayed their aggressive behavior [Doutrelant]. Therefore, indicating that the energy needed to put forth intraspecific agonistic behaviors can be conserved if the fish does is not in a situation by which their survival is threatened. 

One limitation of the study was that the researchers did not know when the fish were last fed. A fish was observed feeding on one flake of food in two trials out of the nine in the experiment. However, aggressive behaviors did not appear to increase in the presence of more food. Another limitation to the experiment may have been habituation, despite 10-minute breaks given to each fish between the trial periods. As seen in many cases, once the fish is exposed to another for an extended period, it may never return to the same level of aggression it had towards it initially [Clayton: 1967]. All fish in this experiment decreased the number of red manes displayed from the control of no food to the experimental condition of a lot of food. Replicates of this study may use the experimental condition of a lot of food as the control for the experiment to better observe the agonistic behavior of the Betta splendens when the resource is gradually restricted. 

In summation, it is important to understand the agonistic behaviors of aquatic animals to better predict their chances of survival in the presence of pollution. Though efforts are being put forth to regulate environmental damage caused by large industries, it is very difficult to regulate decisions of environmental consciousness of individuals. Many choose to discard their prescriptions by flushing them down the toilet or dumping them in a drain. Despite the efforts of waste management plants, these drugs often leak into waterways. A study conducted in 2012 found that common prescription drugs for mental health greatly reduced the level of aggression and attempts at courtship of male Betta splendens [Dzieweczynski: 2012]. This lack of aggression may greatly contribute to a decreasing rate of survival for the fish. That, in addition to poor aquatic environments and exploitation of fish populations, can cause the species to become endangered and approaching extinction.
