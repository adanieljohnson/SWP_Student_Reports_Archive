Title: The Inhibition of Muscle Contraction in Frog Legs due to Injection of Lanthanum Chloride

Abstract:
Frog legs are important to study because they function similarly to human muscles.  Both require action potentials and calcium to cause muscular contractions.  In this experiment, we injected the frog legs with Lanthanum Chloride, which is a calcium channel blocker.  We hypothesized that Lanthanum Chloride will completely inhibit muscular contraction.  Muscular contraction was prevented, but not completely.  Additionally, we cannot conclude if the inhibited muscular contraction occurred by chance or not.  Further study is required to determine if it did or not.

Introduction:
Frog legs are interesting muscles to study because they closely model human leg muscles.  The gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve are responsible for the contraction of the leg and they also controll the responses to certain stimuli the leg receives.  There is multiple process that must occur for the leg muscle to contract.  Calcium is vital to the process of muscular contraction.  Calcium essentially allows the contractile muscle to be activated.  Without calcium, the muscle may not contract.  For this experiment, we will inject the gastrocnemus muscle with 0.2 Ml of Lanthanum Chloride.  Lanthanum Chloride will essentially close the calcium channels.  Therefore, we hypothesize that Lanthanum Chloride will completely inhibit contractions.

Materials and Method:
The first step is to deglove the frog skin.  There is no need to expose the sciatic nerve because we are not testing it in this experiment.  Then, clip the Achilles tendon and tie a string near where you clipped the tendon, leaving a loop on the string exposed.  Next, connect the string to the hook to the research grade electrophysiology equipment called a Transducer at approximately a 90* angle.  Then, adjust the device to make sure the frog leg is not too tightly hooked onto the machine.  You want the frog leg to be loose but still perpendicular to the table.  Next, you pin the frog leg down and attach electrodes to the gastrocnemus muscle.  Then, on the computer, you shock the muscle with various amps of electricity and record the results.  Do this for every leg.  Finally, inject the gastrocnemus muscle in various places with 0.2 Ml of Lanthanum Chloride and wait for 10 minutes.  Then test the leg again and record the results.

Results:
We recorded the results from 3 different frog legs all exposed to the same amps and same amount of time exposed to Lanthanum Chloride.  The data from frog leg 1 is to be omitted because it is incorrect.  We attached the frog leg too tightly to the hook which made the responses to the stimuli seem larger than they actually are.  Prior to testing frog legs 2 and 3, we asked Dr. Munday what we should do because we expected the legs exposed to lanthanum chloride to have less response to amps than the controll group.  He suggested that we massage the muscle for a few minutes and put the electrode at the base of the muscle, resting on the plate, rather than near the middle of the muscle.  Below are charts consisting of the data recorded from all 6 tests we ran.

Discussion
 We had some initial troubles with the experiment, but overall it was successful.  The only trouble we ran into was with our first frog leg after it was injected with Lanthanum Chloride.  The probe had too much tension, which skewed our results.  The increased tension in the leg made the machine recorded a small response in the leg as bigger than it actually was.  When the leg was shocked, there was no visible reaction, yet the voltage response collected was bigger than 1 mV, which means there should have been some response that could have been observed.  Therefore, the data from experimental frog leg 1 must be omitted because it is not viable.  From the non-omitted data that we collected, we conclude that our hypothesis was rejected by this experiment.  We hypothesized that the muscular contractions would stop completely, and they did not.  Even if we hypothesized that muscular contraction would be reduced after the injection on Lanthanum Chloride, we would still not have enough evidence to prove that Lanthanum Chloride does limit contractions.  
According to our statistical test we ran, there is a rather large chance that the differences we observed have occurred by chance.  If we did not mess up the first leg in the experimental group, it may be possible to have obtained a more accurate representations of the effect Lanthanum Chloride on the muscular contraction.  Even without being able to support our hypothesis with strong confidence, other experiments can help support our hypothesis.  Frank Goodman and George Weiss did an experiment where they tested Lanthanum Chloride on the muscular contraction of rabbits.  They found that “Lanthanum ion inhibits contractile responses induced by K , NE and histamine (inhibition of K &gt; NE&gt; histamine) in rabbit aortic smooth muscle. At some superficial cellular Ca44 binding sites, La also appears to displace Ca44 and to prevent rebinding or reuptake of Ca44.” [Frank Goodman and George Weiss; 1971].  Our experiment does not have enough evidence to prove that Lanthanum Chloride effects muscular contraction.  However, with more studies and more tests of Lanthanum Chloride on frog legs, we may eventually be able to confidently say that Lanthanum Chloride does inhibit muscular contractions, as Goodman et al. have been able to conclude.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 displays, graphically, the data that is presented in Chart 1, Chart 2, and Chart 3.  Typically, as the voltage stimulation increases, so does the response to that stimuli.  There was an error setting up the experimental frog leg 1.  We had too much tension on the leg, and therefore our data is likely incorrect for experimental frog leg 1.  We have decided to omit the frog leg 1 data from our experiment, but we still record and discuss it.  We set up the experimental frog legs 2 and 3 correctly and recorded their results.  

Figure 2 displays, graphically, the data that is presented in Chart 1, Chart 2, and Chart 3 for the experimental groups.  Again, typically, as the voltage stimulation increases, so does the response to that stimuli.  Frog Leg 1, however, is to be omitted from the rest of the experiment.  We had too much tension between the transducer and the frog leg, increasing the response to levels that did not make sense with what we expected.  We asked Dr. Munday and he suggested that we massage the leg, decrease the tension, and omit the data from the experiment.*************************************************************************
