Title: The Effect of Various Sodium Chloride Concentrations on the Photosynthetic Activity of Chloroplasts from Spinacia Oleracea

Abstract:
This report details the effects of exposing high levels of sodium concentration, Sodium  Chloride, to chloroplasts from spinach leaves known as Spinacia Oleracea. Our experiment was done in one class setting and included four spinach leaves from which the chloroplasts were extracted in order to conduct the experiment. The chloroplasts were reacted with various concentrations of NaCl ranging from 0.2M to 0.6M. This report also details the results of our experiment that matched the research done prior by scientists — showing that there is an increase in the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts after the addition of a sodium buffer. A two tailed t-test was run on our results with each statistical test comparing the control group to an individual experimental group. Thus, giving us three separate p-values — 0.06, 0.3, and 0.05. Due to 2 of our p-value being equivalent to or greater than our set alpha of 0.05, our results were found to not be statistically significant for concentrations of 0.2M and 0.6M NaCl buffer. There was statistical significance in our results with 0.4M of NaCl buffer. This showed that the sodium buffer did not lead to a change in the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts between our control and two of our experimental trials.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants and certain bacteria receive their energy. This crucial cellular process is regulated by converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through the utilization of light. The process of photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplast — which is an organelle in autotrophs that capture sunlight for energy. Chloroplasts also contain a pigment responsible for absorbing photons of light, also known as chlorophyll. Along with that, chloroplasts can vary in their location and their numbers present within different cells and tissues. Chloroplasts are able to carry out their primary function of capturing energy for the cell through the use of the stomata. The gas exchange that occurs when the stomata are open is what assists with the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is taken in from the atmosphere through the stomata and oxygen is released as a waste product. There are also guard cells present in the stomata that control its coordinated opening and closing in response to surrounding environmental conditions.

In an experiment done by W. John S. Downton, W. James R. Grant, and Simon P. Robinson in 1985, the impact of sodium chloride on the photosynthetic activity — specifically in relation to the function of the stomata, was tested. Their experiment was conducted by slowly increasing the amount of salt concentration the Spinach oleracea, also known as spinach leaves, were exposed to over the course of three weeks. As a result, the presence of sodium chloride in the water given to the spinach leaves decreased the plants’ photosynthetic activity [Downton: 1985]. Another observance was the physical presence of the spinach leaves were altered to being thicker than before the exposure to sodium chloride. Ultimately, this caused less chlorophyll to be present per unit area [Downton: 1985]. Due to this, there was a decrease was observed in stomatal opening, thus limiting the amount of carbon dioxide available in the tissue of the spinach leaves [Downton: 1985]. The closing of the stomata was directly related to the loss of water available to the guard cells in response to the high levels of salt concentration in the environment. In 1987, researchers Guenther and Melis conducted another experiment in regard to the effects of salinity on the growth and photosynthetic process in spinach leaves. The process of photosynthesis was expected to decrease in the plants due to stress [Guenther: 1987]. Their experiment was done by growing the spinach leave for a course of five weeks and increasing levels of salt concentration. In their study, it was found that with increasing levels of NaCl concentration, growth declined which was more significant in the leaves than in the roots [Guenther: 1987]. 

For our experiment, four Spinacia Oleracea, otherwise known as spinach leaves, were used since they contained large veins that could easily be separated. With the knowledge provided from prior experiments combined with our knowledge in regard to the role of the stomata and chloroplast in the process of photosynthesis, we developed a hypothesis primarily based off of the previously mentioned experiments. We predicted that by adding concentrations of salt buffer, there would be a decrease in the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts due to the process being disrupted significantly in the stomata. So — in theory, we assumed that by the stomata not being able to function properly with salt concentrations present, there would be an increase observed in absorbance and thus meaning less photosynthetic activity.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment was conducted in two parts — part one was constructed to obtain the chloroplasts from the spinach leaves. This was done in order to perform the second part of the experiment — testing the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts at various levels of sodium buffer. To start, all necessary materials were gathered and placed in an ice bath to cool. This included a mortar and pestle, a medium sized beaker, and three, 50 mL centrifuge tubes. Along with that, the various buffers were added to the ice bath as well. The experiment commenced by removing the large central veins from four fairly large spinach leaves. In order to get excess dirt and other material off of the spinach leaves, they were rinsed with tap water and blotted using paper towels. Once they were clean, the spinach leaves were placed inside the previously iced mortar along with 10 mL of cold grinding buffer. This grinding buffer consisted of 400 mM sucrose Tricine buffer at pH 8. The spinach was then ground using the pestle until it was a thick paste and no large chunks of leaves were present. Another 10 mL of grinding buffer was added using a pipette to the mortar containing the paste. The grounding of the spinach leaves continued again until they became more of a green liquid. The remaining mixture of spinach leaves and grinding buffer was strained through multiple layers of cheesecloth and placed within the chilled beaker.  From this mixture, 200 micrometers was transferred from the beaker into a microtube with the label “Sample of A” and placed on ice.

The remaining green liquid was transferred to an iced 50 mL centrifuge tube with the marking “A”. This was spun at two-hundred times the force of gravity for a total of three minutes. Once this was complete, the supernatants from tube “A” were poured into another chilled centrifuge tube with the label “B”. The final round of centrifuging was conducted at 1,000 times the force of gravity for a total of ten minutes. Again, the supernatants from this tube were poured into another chilled centrifuge tube marked as “C”. Once this was complete due to our chloroplasts successfully being extracted with little to no debris present, we were able to commence part two of our laboratory experiment.

To start, thirteen large test tubes were obtained and numbered accordingly based on the presented table. So, the test tubes were marked with numbers ranging from 0-12 and placed on a test tube rack. During this time, the spectrophotometer was set at 600 nm. The test tube numbered 0 served as the blank for this experiment. Within this test tube, only 8 mL of water and 2 mL of reaction buffer were added. The following test tubes, 1-12, all contained 6 mL of water and 2 mL of reaction buffer. The next three test tubes, 1-3, contained 100 microliters of chloroplast from the centrifuge tube “C”. These three test tubes served as the control for the experiment since no salt solution buffer was added. The next three test tubes, 4-6, contained 100 microliters of chloroplasts in 0.2M NaCl solution. Test tubes 7-9 contained 100 microliters of chloroplasts in 0.4M NaCl buffer. Test tubes 10-12 contained chloroplasts in 0.6M NaCl buffer solution.  All of the test tubes were mixed before being transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Once the spectrophotometer was blanked using test tube 0, the absorbance for all of the samples was measured. This was our time 0 data points. 

Next, the samples were carefully placed under the light for 10 minutes before their absorbances were measured again using the spectrophotometer. The same step was repeated of placing the samples under the light for another 10 minutes — so, a total of 20 minutes before recording the absorbance values of the samples again. Finally, the previous step was repeated one last time, for a total of 30 minutes and the absorbance of the 12 samples was taken again. All of the results was recorded in the table. Once all of the data was collected, a two tailed t-test was run on all of the concentrations of salt buffer in comparison to the control group — ultimately giving three p-values. This was used to analyze our data and determine the outcome of our experiment.

Results:
The first experimental trial, with the 0.2M of NaCl buffer solution, showed an unexpected decrease in absorbance. Thus, an increase in photosynthetic activity was depicted upon adding NaCl solution to the chloroplasts. The remaining experimental trials depicted this same trend of decrease in absorbance, meaning an increase in photosynthetic activity, with 0.4M and 0.6M of NaCl buffer added to the chloroplasts. The experimental trials were compared to the control group, which consisted of no salt solution. The p-value for the control in comparison to the 0.2M of NaCl was calculated as 0.06. The second p-value for the control in relation to the 0.4M of NaCl was found as 0.3. Furthermore, the final p-value comparing the control group with the 0.6M of NaCl was found to be 0.05. All of the p-values are greater than or equal to the set alpha of 0.5. 

Generally, all of the trials showed an increasing trend in photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts after the addition of NaCl solution. Since each trial, including the control, consisted of three test tubes, there was an excess of raw data. Therefore, in Figure 1, 2, and 3, our results of each absorbance are averaged so the difference in absorbance of the chloroplasts are displayed more clearly.

Discussion:
Based on our results not being statistically significant, our hypothesis was not supported and we reject our initial hypothesis. For this laboratory experiment, there were three separate p-values calculated comparing each experimental group with the control group. The p-values were calculated as 0.06, 0.3, and 0.05 after running a two tailed t-test. Due to our p-values all being either larger or equal to our set alpha of 0.05, this means there was no statistical significance between the results of our experimental groups and control. Since our results showed an increase in the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts upon addition of the NaCl buffer — opposite of our hypothesis was true. Based on the experiments we evaluated, our results are fairly accurate in terms of consistency — meaning, as the concentration of NaCl introduced to the chloroplast increased, so did the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts.

The results of our experimental were supported by research done prior by multiple scientists. A case study was conducted in 1983 by Robinson, Downtown, and Millhouse that found results similar to ours and can provide an accurate explanation for our decrease in photosynthetic activity. In their experiment, it was found that salt stress does not have a correlation with the photosynthetic activity of spinach leaves; but instead, the decline in photosynthetic activity could be due to solely an effect on the stomatal conductance [Robinson: 1983]. Along with that, it was determined that chloroplasts shift their ion exchanges in order to account for the environmental changes, and therefore shifting potassium ions for sodium ions in order to allow and equal charge to be present at all times and no extensive damage to occur within the plant [Robinson: 1983]. Another case study that helped to explain our unexpected results was an experiment done by Richard Neiman in 1962. In this case study, the various effects of sodium chloride was observed on multiple crops [Nieman: 1962]. The various plants were grown in a greenhouse and given ranging salt concentrations. It was found that there was no correlation between the levels of salt concentration on the photosynthetic activity of the leaf samples. Along with that, the activity of the chlorophyll alone was higher in the leaves which is consistent with the results our laboratory experiment [Nieman: 1962]. More specifically, it was concluded by Nieman that there was no substantial decrease in photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts as levels of NaCl increased [Nieman: 1962].  Along with that, a case study done by Iwaza and Good in 1966 explains how the effect on photosynthetic activity could also be due to the chloroplasts conforming to the environmental changes. So, they begin growing in response to increasing levels of sodium chloride in the plant’s surroundings and therefore increasing the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts [Iwaza: 1966].

In the future, we would try to reconstruct the experiment more efficiently so there could be a statistical significance observe in our results. This could be done by creating a more appropriate method plan since the one used for this experiment was at times a bit confusing and could have caused error in our results. We would also have more samples used in our experimental trials in order to get a larger sample size and results. This experiment is important to understand since 
his study is important as it pertains to plants and their resistance to salt. Along with that, contaminated water could have salt that damages plants, and by knowing their tolerance, people such as farmers can understand which areas is best or worst to grow certain plants.
