Title: No difference shown in resource allocation by Roots: Shoots ratio in response to herbivory in Fagopyrum Esculentum

Abstract:
Obtaining limited abiotic resources is a major challenge of plants in an ecosystem. Plants must develop certain pattern of resource allocation to maximize the utility of the resources they gained. Environment stimuli would influence their trade-off pattern. The objective of this study was to discover the effect of herbivory on resource allocation of plants. Fagopyrum Esculentum was used as the model organism in the study and herbivory was simulated by artificially cutting holes on the leaves. The resource allocation pattern was indicated by Root: Shoot ratio (R:S ratio). The hypothesis was that the subjects treated with herbivory would have a lower R:S ratio than those that were not. The study found that there was no statistically significent difference between the experiment and controll group, suggesting that herbivory tend not to change the resource allocation in plants. I inferred that plants might use its resource to fight against herbivory instead of changing resource allocation in growing structure. Further study would be carried out concerning the new assumption and amend the flaws in experiment design that might have caused the result to be not significent. 

Introduction:
In any ecological community, biotic factors and abiotic factors influence plants and animals on every aspect, from energy capture to fitness [Johnson: 2016]. Abiotic factors refer to the non-living sources in the environment that affect the ecosystem and the organisms in it. Many intraspecific and interspecific plant interactions revolve around obtaining abiotic resources since those resources are normally limited in the ecosystem on earth. As a result, plants must develop certain pattern to allocate the resources they gained as they attempt to maximize their fitness [Seabloom: 2018]. The trade-off process is called resource allocation [Bazzaz: 1997]. Typical resource allocation example includes expending more energy to grow a particular structure while reducing the energy input on another [Johnson: 2016]. Normally, leaves are the principal photosynthetic organ of the plant; roots are the primary absorptive organ and anchor the plant to the soil [Johnson: 2016]. In drought condition, plants would grow more roots and less leaves to ensure the water supply. Because the relative mass and length of the structure can indicate the resource devoted to the structure in a given environment, the Root: Shoot ratio was used to examine the resource allocation condition (refer as R:S ratio below). In real environment, herbivores exert a major impact on plants. It increases plants’ mortality and removes the resources that could be allocated to reproduction or growth [Coley: 1985]. Plants typically utilize broad defensive traits against herbivories, including reallocating attained resources [Agrawal: 2006]. For the reason that the plants are losing leaf area, I expected that the plants would allocate more resources to shoot rather than root. I hypothesized that the experiment group with herbivory would have a lower R:S ratio than the controll group. In this case the presence of herbivory would be the independent variable while the R:S ratio being the dependent variable. For the setup of our study, Fagopyrum Esculentum, commonly known as buckwheat, was picked as our experimental subject. It is chosen because of its short life period. It has a growing period for only 10-12 weeks [Kreft: 1989]. 

Materials and Method:
Four pots of soil with seeds were prepared for both experiment group and controll group. Then all the pots were thoroughly watered to ensure that enough amount of seeds would sprout. All pots were kept together in a green house. The plants were watered every day for twelve days to obtain the result. After the plants sprouted, four plants from each pot of experiment group was selected to investigate herbivory effect. Because of the restriction of study condition, a small hole was cut on each leaf every day to simulate herbivory. 
After twelve days, four plants from each pot were harvested intact. The total 32 selected plants were patted dry with paper towels to avoid the influence of water on weight. The shoot was separated from root at the point of color changing. Next, I weighed each individual plant’s root and shoot separately, and measured their length. 
My hypothesis was tested by comparing the mean value of R:S ratio (mass) and R:S ratio (length) for experiment and controll group. One-tailed two-sample t_test was used to evaluate if the effect of herbivory was significent in the R:S. 

Results:
When observing the plants on the final day, the experiment group generally seemed slightly larger than the controll group although they had holes on their leaves. There was no distinguishable difference in the color of the plants. According to the data, the mean R:S ratio (mass) of experiment plants was 0.28 ± 0.17 and that of controll plants was 0.26 ± 0.06 (Fig.1). The mean R:S ratio (length) of experiment plants was 0.83 ± 0.26 and that of controll plants was 0.97 ± 0.27 (Fig.2). The mean of the mass experiment group was not statistically significently different than that of the mass controll group (t_stat=0.38, d.f.=30, P=0.35). The mean of the length experiment group was not statistically significently different than that of the length controll group either (t_stat=1.45, d.f.=30, P=0.08). 

Discussion:
Overall, there was no significent difference between the resource allocation strategy in the experiment and controll group. My hypothesis that the experiment group with herbivory would have a lower R:S ratio than the controll group was rejected. The presence of herbivory did not appear to influence the resource allocation of plants. I suggest that there might be several reasons contributing to this result. First, plants may reduce the resource allocated to both root and shoot to develop other defense against herbivory. Herbivory would reduce the biomass and height of plants, and thus decrease the survivorship and reproduction rate [Carson: 2000]. Since the damage is relatively high to the plants, the plants that develop antiherbivore defenses would be favored in selection [Coley: 1985]. Because plants need additional resources to generate the defenses, resources distributed to growth would generally be reduced, including resources allocated to both roots and shoots. Since roots and shoots are decreasing at the same time, the R:S ratio will keep at the same level. Second, the plant may be growing more root to absorb energy, compensating the lost resources in leaf, which provides one explanation to the higher R:S mass in experiment group. Third, the experiment method determined that the measured shoot mass was lower than the actual mass the plants grown using the resources due to the holes on the leaves. It might be another reason for the R:S mass in experiment group to be higher. Fourth, the plants might not be given enough time to develop a different resource allocation strategy since I only did the study for twelve days. For future study, the study time period could be elongated to observe morphological change and difference in R:S ratio. I could also introduce actual herbivory insects instead of simulating the behavior to make the study assemble natural environment more. Another study direction would be to investigate the influence of herbivory on the overall plant growth and fitness level instead of resource allocation.
