Title: Study of the Effects of Nitrogen on Vigna radinta Growth

Abstract:
This lab report details an experiment exploring the effects of excess nitrogen on the growth and development of Mung Bean plants (Vigna radinta). This plant is one of the most ancient forms of bean plants, orginally found in India, it was rapidly integrated in other parts of Asia, South America, and Australia. Over a two week period two sets of mung bean plants were watered with two mixtures, one high in nitrogen and the other with regular levels of nitrogen. After that period of time we measured and weighed the stems and roots of each individual plant to determine if excessive nitrogen had any effect on the plant growth. We hypothesized that plants growing in a low nitrogen environment would have a lower root to shoot (R:S) ratio than plants growing in a high nitrogen environment. Ultimately proving that there was no significant difference in the growth over two weeks of plants in low and high nitrogenous environments. This could have been because of the period of time given for growth of the plant; a longer period could have yielded other results. Further research could also study the allocation of excessive nitrogen within the plant and where and why it affects or accumulates in those regions of the plant. 

Introduction:
In this experiment we decided to investigate the effect of nitrogen on mung bean growth. The mung bean (Vigna radinta) is indigenous to India and has been grown there for most of ancient history. Today it is still grown in the majority of Asia and has also spread to Africa, South America, and Australia. Mung beans are a warm season crop requiring regular watering [Oplinger, Hardman, Kaminski, Combs, Doll:1997]. Excessive amounts of Nitrogen in soil can increase the pH of the soil around root zones and Mung beans require a slightly acidic soil for best growth [Oplinger, Hardman, Kaminski, Combs, Doll:1997][GuanWenjing:2016]. The difference in acidity could result in poor root development, causing the plant to become top heavy. In this experiment I wanted to see how adding an excess of nitrogen to the plants nutrients would affect the growth of the mung bean, in comparing the roots to the shoots in terms of development. I hypothesized that plants growing in a low nitrogen environment would have a lower root to shoot (R:S) ratio than plants growing in a high nitrogen environment. I expect this result because the R:S ratio should be higher in the plants grown in a high nitrogen environment because root development will be hindered in this environment, leading to the higher ratio. To test this theory two groups of plants were watered regularly for two weeks and measurements were taken after the specified period of time. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, one treatment group with 4 replicants and one control group with 4 replicants were used. I prepared 8 pots with soil and proceeded to plant 10-15 mung bean seeds in each pot. These many seeds were planted so that it would be guaranteed that at least some of them would grow to full size.  After planting the seeds in the pots, I labeled four of the pots treatment and the other four pots control and then placed them in the greenhouse. For the next 2 weeks they were watered and for the treatment group a dissolvable nitrogen was added to the water to create a solution that the plants were then watered with. After 2 weeks we then harvested the mung beans by removing them from the pots being careful not to break the root structure or stems of the plants. Then the root and stem length were measured as well as the weight of the root and stem. Ultimately, 50 plants were measured from the control group and 4 plants from the treatment group. After the measurements we used a one tallied  two sample T-test to determine if our findings were conclusive or not. 

Results:
After the two weeks of watering the plats were harvested and measured and the results of our experiment showed that there was no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group in both length R:S ratio (P-value: 0.0567, DF: 52, T-Value: 1.609, Figure 2). The treatment group had a mean and standard deviation of 1.389 and 0.117 respectively and the control group had a mean and standard deviation of 1.134 and .0376 respectively. The data comparing the weights of the treatment group and control group was also insignificant with a weight R:S ratio (P-value: 0.343, DF: 52, T-Value: 0.405, Figure 1). The treatment group had a mean and standard deviation of 0.841 and 0.182 respectively and the control group had a mean and standard deviation of .241 respectively. These results mean that our hypothesis is rejected because there was not a significant difference in the data collected. 

Discussion:
 The data collected in this experiment ultimately proved to be insignificant leading to the conclusion that the amount of nitrogen used did not cause a large enough on the growth of the plant. This means that the hypothesis was rejected. There could be many reasons why the results recorded were not the same as the results expected. High humidity can influence the rate at which the mung bean plant matures [Oplinger, Hardman, Kaminski, Combs, Doll:1997], so the plants that were harvested might have been the most mature they could have been in a 2 week period. However, I think that this has to do with were the plant stores nitrogen. In plants Nitrogen is primarily used in chlorophyll production, which occurs in the leaf structures of the plant. An excessive amount of nitrogen could have stimulated more leaf growth than cause a difference in R:S ratio[RodriguezAmy:2018]. I expect that further research into the allocation of nitrogen in the mung bean would shed more light on the effects of nitrogen on the growth and development of the plant. It would be interesting to focus more on the leaf development of the plant, comparing the leaf surface area and weight of plants in low and high nitrogenous environments. This would account for the use of nitrogen in chlorophyll production and test for rapid leaf growth and development. Also, the time period in which this experiment was conducted could have been too short for a real developmental difference to become apparent in the treatment and control groups. Perhaps a longer experiment, over 4-6 weeks would allow for the effect of nitrogen on plant growth to become more apparent.
