Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Physarum polycephalum cell signaling in the Cyclic Adenosine 3’,5’-Monophosphate-mediated Pathway 

Abstract:
: All animals use cell signaling to respond to stimuli and react accordingly. Cell signaling is difficult to observe in cells, therefore the protist Physarum polycephalum is used instead. This slime mold spends most of its life in a plasmodial stage in which mass of nuclei within a single plasma membrane will behave as a single organized cell. Physarum uses the cAMP-mediated cell signaling pathway, in which cAMP is the secondary messenger that signals to other molecules, to promote movement and “crawl” along surfaces in search of food. Caffeine has been experimentally determined to inhibit phosphodiesterase which is used in the cAMP pathway to breakdown cAMP. We hypothesized that inhibition of phosphodiesterase would allow cAMP to continue signaling and promote movement of the Physarum. The results of the data supported our hypothesis and, compared to a control sample, caffeine caused a significant change in how much Physarum moved towards food within 24 hours.

Introduction:
All animals utilize cell signaling to react to stimuli, coordinate a response via messenger molecules, and make the necessary changes to maintain homeostasis. Due to the difficulty of observing cell signaling within individual animal cells, the protist slime mold Physarum polycephalum is used instead. Physarum spends most of its life cycle in the plasmodial phase. In this stage, the physarum slime mold mass will behave as a single organized cell, or rather, a multinucleated syncytium—a mass of nuclei within a single plasma membrane. During this phase, the mass moves and searches for food by constantly “crawling” with its actin microfilaments. Since the syncytium behaves like a single cell, it is useful to observe how the syncytium reacts to experiments instead of studying individual animal cells. By examining how Physarum reacts to stimuli, it allows for better understanding of how single cells use signal transduction pathways to react external stimuli. One of the major pathways Physarum uses for movement is the Cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP)-mediated pathway. This pathway proceeds by stimuli eventually activating cAMP, the second messenger molecule, which can be promoted or inhibited by different chemical compounds. In the cAMP-mediated pathway, cell signaling stops when phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP.  This lab focuses on how the protist Physarum polycephalum’s cell signaling responds to exposure of caffeine. Caffeine is experimentally known to be an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (Johnson:2016). Inhibiting phosphodiesterase causes the same response as stimulating production of cAMP since the signaling molecule cannot be broken down(Johnson:2016). Futhermore, Dr. Levin, Dr. Greenberg, and Dr. Wein support this research as they found in their own research that caffeine in high concentrations, significantly increased metabolism and motility of human sperm cells in semen (Levin:1981). Sperm motility is also attributed to cAMP present in the cells. Their research showed an increase in cellular levels of cAMP after “mixed inhibition” of phosphodiesterase by caffeine(Levin:1981). We hypothesize that by stimulating Physarum with caffeine, to inhibit breakdown of cAMP and continue signaling, the slime mold will show more growth and migration than normal.

Materials and Methods:
First, six water agar plates were obtained and three were labeled “control” and the other three labeled “with caffeine”. Next, 1mL of 20X stock solution caffeine was diluted into 19mL of water to a final concentration of 1X. After mixing the caffeine/water solution, 6mL were added to each plate labeled “with caffeine”. After approximately 20 minutes of waiting for the agar to absorb the solution, excess liquid was gently and carefully dabbed off with Kim lab wipes. Next, using a sterile spatula one approximately 1cm x 1cm square was cut in the middle of each plate. The spatula was sanitized each time by dipping it into an ethanol solution. Being sure to sterilize before each transfer, each square in the experimental and control plates were then filled with a square of the same size from the Physarum stock plate, making sure the Physarum stock square was well colonized by the slime mold and was placed upwards. Finally, about 5-6 oatmeal flakes were scattered at the tops of each of the plates. The plates were the wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in an incubator at 37 C for 24 hours. The following day the growth of the Physarum towards the oatmeal was measured and recorded. A one-tailed T-test will be run to determine the statistical significance of the results.

Results:
The results show the average growth of Physarum with caffeine (11.33+/- 1.25) was significantly higher than average growth of the control plates (2.33+/-0.47). The one tailed t-test run on the data yielded a P-value of 0.000336297 which showed the results were statistically significant.

Discussion:
Cells respond to external stimuli by activating different signal transduction pathways. Since individual cells are difficult to observe, the slime mold Physarum polycephalum can be utilized since its plasmodial life stage is a multinucleated syncytium, which behaves as a single cell would. One of the main signaling pathways that Physarum uses for movement is the cAMP-mediated pathway. This pathway responds to external stimuli and will signal a response by using cAMP as a secondary messenger. This allows for the pathways to be selectively inhibited or promoted. It is experimentally known that caffeine is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme used in the cAMP-mediated signaling pathway to stop signaling by breaking down cAMP (Johnson:2016). Inhibition of phosphodiesterase thus causes the same response as stimulating cAMP production (Johnson:2016). With this knowledge, we hypothesized that treating Physarum with caffeine would promote more movement since it would block phosphodiesterase and thus prevent the Physarum to stop the signal for movement. The hypothesis was supported by the data of the lab since the Physarum treated with caffeine on average moved more (11.33+/- 1.25mm) than the control Physarum samples (2.33+/- 0.47mm) (Figure 1). Furthermore, the results of the experiment were determined to be statistically significant (p-value=0.000336297) and likely did not occur due to error or chance. The results supported that caffeine was an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, since the increased movement was a result of intracellular cAMP buildup. The cAMP would have been broken down by phosphodiesterase had it not been inhibited by caffeine, which shares a similar chemical structure to adenosine. This similarity means caffeine likely binds to phosphodiesterase before cAMP can, thus blocking the active site phosphodiesterase uses to act on cAMP. The results of our data were also supported by the research of Drs. Levin, Greenberg, and Wein, which showed an increase in motility of sperm after treatment with caffeine, a “mixed inhibitor” sperm phosphodiesterase (Levin:1981).  It should be noted however, that research by Drs. Brenner and Thoms on the social ameba Dictyostelium discoideum showed that in the cAMP pathways, caffeine did not act on phosphodiesterase, but rather inhibited adenylate cyclase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the change of ATP to cAMP (Brenner:1984). This research offers that caffeine may not be selectively inhibiting phosphodiesterase, and rather may have another mechanism that caused Physarum to have increased movement. For example, caffeine may function by altering intracellular calcium distribution, which, the same mechanism by which the IP3 cell signaling pathway functions (Brenner:1984).  To improve this lab, the Physarum slime mold used for lab should be ensured to be an active strain as to obtain better overall results. Furthermore, intracellular levels of certain molecules could be tracked to better determine by which mechanism caffeine functions on the cAMP pathway. Lastly, more samples could be used to provide more statistically significant data.
