Title: Effects of Neomycin on Signaing Pathways in Physarum polycepholum

Abstract:
Abstract:
	Physarum polycepholum is a slime mold that we will be using as our model organism in this experiment. Physarum uses many signaling pathways to navigate through the environment in which it is placed in, and one such pathway is PLC. We hypothesized that increasing the concentration of the neomycin on the agar plates, then the chemotaxis towards glucose will decrease. This experiment had increasing concentrations of neomycin on water agar plates with Physarum in the middle and glucose on the edge of the plate. After letting the neomycin grow for 24 hours, we measured the distance traveled then calculated the rate of growth under those conditions. This research is important because it will further our understanding on signaling processes and can help us understand the human body more. 


Introduction:
Introduction:
In this experiment, we are investigating the signaling effects used by slime mold. The slime mold that we will be using as our model organism is called Physarum polycepholum. This organism is a multinucleate syncytium, meaning it is a mass of multiple nuclei contained within a single plasma membrane. Each Physarum mass (called a plasmodium) and behaves as a single giant cell [4]. It is an organism without a nervous system, yet it still exhibits intelligent behavior like those in eusocial insects, like bees and ants. They will search and find the shortest route to food and move away from harmful substances/environments [1]. There are many factors that allow for Physarum to react in such a way without a nervous system, and this is due to an array of signaling methods and secondary signals. One specific signal is that related to the chemotaxis towards glucose is PLC. In this specific experiment, we will be increasing the concentration of neomycin (a PLC inhibitor) which will increasingly decrease chemotaxis motility toward glucose. Here we will find out whether this signaling effect is influencing the chemotaxis in the slime mold, furthering our understanding of signaling effects and of PLC. Our research question is whether the addition of an inhibitor will reduce the rate at which the slime mold grows toward food. We hypothesized that increasing the concentration of the neomycin on the agar plates, then the chemotaxis towards glucose will decrease.


Materials and Methods:
Methods:
Materials-
•	Physarum polycepholum
•	Spatula
•	Ethanol
•	Agar plates
•	Neomycin
Procedure-
When we started the experiment, we made sure everything was sterile with ethanol. After that, we started to prepare our 9 agar plates. We labeled them as 5x, 2x, and 1x due to the concentrations of neomycin we were using. We drew a line on the back and made 3, 1x1 cm holes with the spatula, sterilizing in between each hole. After we cut out the blocks from each agar plate, we placed normal agar in all the holes labeled blank, our Physarum sample in the middle holes, and our experimental sample in the final hole. To form our experimental samples, we diluted our 20x stock neomycin (1mg/1mL) down to 5x, 2x, and 1x. After we had our desired concentrations, we soaked separate agar plates with the desired experimental concentration and then cut holes to place the blocks into the correct experimental agar plate. After we added the agar blocks into the plates, we taped the sides and placed all the agar plates into a black bag and stored them in a drawer away from light. After 24 hours, we came back and measured the growth and direction, then disposed the Physarum. We used a one tailed t-test to test for significance of our results.


Results:
Results:
In order to find the rate of growth of each Physarum sample, we measured the farthest strand of growth and determined if that value was negative or positive depending on which side of the plate the growth was on. The neomycin side was positive and the side with the control was assigned a negative value. We determined which side the growth was on by classifying growth that is perpendicular or more is in the control group (positive value) while less that perpendicular is towards neomycin (negative value). To determine significance, we used 3, one tailed t-tests to compare the rate of growth in each concentration of neomycin. We determined that the p-value between our 1x and 2x was 0.0697, the p-value between 2x and 5x was 0.1775, and the p-value between 1x and 5x was 0.0871. This means that no statistically significant differences in Physarum growth between our neomycin concentrations were found at the 95% confidence interval.


Discussion:
Discussion:
	After looking at our p-values that were received from our t-tests, there is no statically significant evidence that there is a difference in the rate of growth between our neomycin concentration groups. These results do not support our hypothesis, because we hypothesized that as the concentration of neomycin increased, the rate of growth would also decrease. From our statistical tests that compared the concentrations of neomycin, we received p-values of 0.0697, 0.1775, and 0.0871 for 1x vs. 2x, 2x vs 5x, and 1x vs 5x accordingly. This leads us to infer that the chemotaxis of the Physarum was not significantly influenced by the neomycin in this experiment, which is a known inhibitor of PLC [4]. Our hypothesis was based on prior research that PLC is crucial for the chemotaxis and IP3/IP3k signaling pathways [2]. Due to our hypothesis being proven incorrect, this leads us to believe that other parts of the signaling pathway could have bypassed the PLC portion of the chemotaxis chain and continued with growth. The growth that was observed away from the neomycin was longer than toward neomycin on average, but not to the point that it was significant. This is important to our understanding of signaling chains as well as slime molds such as Physarum. There are many signaling chains that are associated with slime mold, and slime mold is a great model organism for deepening our understanding of these pathways and how they interact with their environment and each other. Our understanding of signaling pathways has relevance to the human body as well as medicine. The human body has many signaling pathways, and one that has been identified and observed is LPA as a phospholipid messenger [3]. LPA is an important factor in activating platelets and other bodily functions. There are diseases and disorders where platelet production/activation is abnormal, and with a deeper understanding of this signaling chain, then we could better treat and attack these disorders. The implications of understanding chemical and signaling pathways can help uncover some of the biological mysteries of how the body functions with the environment it is in, and the substances in it. For our experiment, there were some difficulties that were not anticipated while planning our experiment. When cutting out the agar blocks to place in the wells we cut out, they were supposed to be 1x1 cm cubes. Because we were cutting them with the tip of the spatula, there was human error and inconstancy while cutting these blocks. This caused small spaces to form between the block and the rest of the agar plate, allowing the Physarum to grow into the cracks instead of along the surface. This caused detrimental results as growth into the plate was classified as 0 mm, when compared to growth on the surface. If this was done more precisely and we allowed the Physarum to have more time to grow, then the results of the experiment could have differed. Future replications of this experiment should anticipate this outcome and work to make precise cuttings to prevent growth into the plates.
