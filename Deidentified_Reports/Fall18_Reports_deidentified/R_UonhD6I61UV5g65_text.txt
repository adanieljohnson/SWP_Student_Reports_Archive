Title: The effect of injecting the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens with tetraammonium chloride on the threshold for muscle contraction

Abstract:
Muscle contraction is an important feature of body movement that allows organisms to respond through the tensing of the muscle fibers known as a twitch. This experiment observes the effects of injecting tetraammonium chloride (TEA) into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens on the threshold for muscle contraction. It was hypothesized that the threshold would increase due to the TEA causing the potassium ions to remain inside the cell instead of leaving through the voltage gated channels, which would ultimately cause an increase in the amount of sodium it would take to depolarize the cell to threshold. Through stimulating the sciatic nerve of three Northern Leopard frog legs the threshold before and after the injections of .1 Ml TEA were determined using a force transducer and electrode. This resulted in an average decrease in the threshold following the TEA injection as opposed to the expected increase due to the blockage of potassium, with a p_value greater than 0.05. Through observing the abnormal and inconsistent behavior of the legs following the injection the results were deemed insignificent and no further conclusions on the effects of TEA on a muscle twitch could be made through this data.

Introduction:
Movement involves a system of motoneurons and muscle fibers that work together in order to produce muscle contractions in the form of a twitch. Motoneurons that stem from the spinal cord communicate with the muscle fibers through neural impulses called action potentials in response to a stimulus in the environment, or whenever movement is required [Sadava:2017]. The action potential that is conducted in a motoneuron and muscle fiber begins with the depolarization at the dendrites that causes a local change in membrane potential that spreads to the axon hillock. In order to produce the all-or-nothing response of an action potential, the threshold must be met which causes voltage gated Na channels to open at the axon hillock and on the axon. This flow of sodium ions represents the propagation of the action potential, however these sodium channels must close in order to initiate the refractory period that prepares the neuron to conduct another action potential, and this refractory period is additionally comprised of the opening of the voltage gated potassium channels. This efflux of potassium is vital because it allows the cell to repolarize by bringing the cell back to its negative resting potential [Sadava:2017]. This reveals the importance of each phase of an action potential because without depolarization to the threshold value the action potential cannot be conducted within a muscle fiber. Additionally without repolarization the cell cannot bring itself back to resting potential to become able to conduct another action potential for another or a continuous muscle contraction. 

This experiment observes the effects of stimulation on the sciatic nerve of the Rania pipiens species before and after the injection of .1 Ml of tetraammonium chloride (TEA) into the gastrocnemus muscle of the leg. The change in the threshold values are dependent upon the introduction of TEA in to the muscle. When dissected the sciatic nerve is easily visible and obtainable within the leg, which allows for easy accessibility for nerve stimulation making this species a model organism for this experiment. TEA serves as a “potassium-selective ion channel blocker”, which should call into question how the conduction of the action potential will be affected when potassium ions are blocked from leaving the neuron following the influx of sodium [NIH: 2018]. A previous experiment on the sartorius muscle of the Japanese toad demonstrated that injecting fibers with TEA prolonged the duration of the action potential by slowing the repolarization phase [Hagiwara: 1955]. This supports that if the potassium is blocked from leaving the cell then the cell cannot fully return to its normal resting potential value due to the high concentration of potassium that extends the duration of the repolarization phase. Resultantly the threshold to produce another action potential will become a much larger, positive value due to the higher amount of sodium it would take to reverse the membrane potential again. As observed in the Japanese toad, after repetitive stimulation the amplitude of the action potential was reduced and eventually the cell became disabled from producing additional action potentials when a high amount of TEA was introduced due to the increased demand to meet the threshold [Hagiwara: 1955].Therefore if potassium is blocked through introducing TEA into the Northern Leopard frog, the threshold of the sciatic nerve will increase. This ultimately would increase the amount of stimulus and time it would take for the muscle fiber to fire an action potential, slowing the rate of muscle contraction. This may pose problems for an organism if they needed to react to an environmental stimulus quickly if too much TEA is introduced, and could ultimately paralyze the muscle fibers.


Materials and Method:
The leg of the Northern Leopard Frog was placed in a dissecting pan, and forceps were used to pull the skin at the top of the leg down to the food to expose the muscle. The inner thigh muscle was separated in order to reveal the white sciatic nerve, which was then freed from the connective tissue around it. The upper thigh was then pinned to the pan and a string was tied to the tendon that was connected to the force transducer, which was adjusted to a height that provided slight tension to the string. After the leg was properly set up the sciatic nerve was draped on top of the electrode pins laying on the pan and ringers was added to the leg. The Labscribe program was used in order to monitor the muscle contraction. In the stimulator controll panel the stimulus mode was set to pulse, the pulse amplitude to 0.05, number of pulses to 1, the frequency (Hz) to 1, and the pulse width to 5 ms. Next the pulse amplitude was applied and recorded until the first muscle contraction was presented on the screen while also visibly demonstrated as a small jerk in the leg. Depending on the resulting voltage of the twitch the pulse amplitude was either raised or lowered until the smallest amount of stimulation was determined. The smallest voltage that produced a twitch was recorded as that frog leg’s threshold for muscle contraction before the TEA was added. Next .1 Ml of TEA was injected all throughout the gastrocnemus muscle and the same process for finding the twitch threshold was determined using the force transducer and electrode pin. This process of determining the threshold for muscle contraction of the frog leg before and after the injection of the TEA was repeated on two other identical frog legs. A one tailed paired t_test was used to compare the controll and experimental threshold values in order to test the effects of TEA on the muscle contraction of the Northern Leopard frog leg.

Results:
Overall each frog leg demonstrated very different responses to the ringer and stimulation from the electrodes. The first frog leg demonstrated took a substantial amount of time and stimulation before any twitch was produced and revealed a slight decrease in threshold that was generated by a slightly smaller stimulus amplitude. The second and third frog leg behaved very differently compared to the first leg after the ringer was added, both twitching sporadically before the stimulation and after being disconnected from the electrode as if the leg were still attached to a living frog. During stimulation of the second and third frog leg it was fairly difficult to observe when the muscle twitched due to stimulation from the force transducer because it remained in a constant twitching state the entirety of the experiment. Additionally, when the second and third leg were pinned to the pan, as soon as each nerve was draped over the electrodes the leg bent abruptly which interfered with the placement of the electrodes. This required additional pins to hold each leg down to ensure that it did not touch the electrodes. The second frog leg showed the largest decrease in threshold with a small reduction of stimulus amplitude that it took to generate this force. In contrast the final frog leg revealed a small increase in threshold while maintaining the same amplitude stimulation to produce both thresholds before and after adding TEA. The results of the experiment revealed that the thresholds for the legs prior to TEA averaged at 0.03433± .01963 and the legs following TEA injection averaged at 0.01743± .016086 (Fig. 1). The paired t_test revealed that the threshold averages for the controll and experimental data were not statistically significently different (t_stat=0.896198, d.f.=2, P=.464722).

Discussion:
The results of this study revealed that the controll and experimental data were not statistically significently different. Overall there was a slight decline in the average threshold when given the TEA, however the results were concluded as insignificent due to evidence of error found within this experiment. First the thresholds for each leg before the 0.1 Ml of TEA was added were much lower than normal, which may be explained by the inappropriate behaviors of the legs with the first being overly stagnant and the other two being overly active. Secondly the TEA demonstrated little to no effect on the threshold for the Rania pipiens muscle contraction as the values revealed very little and inconsistent change that either increased or decreased. This also may be attributed to the excessive twitching or the very low activity demonstrated by the legs. Due to this abnormal behavior that revealed inconsistent changes to the threshold our hypothesis can neither be confirmed or denied based on this specific data. Ultimately with stimulating the sciatic nerve of the frog leg after injecting .1 Ml of TEA into the gastrocnemus muscle the blocked potassium should have caused an increase in the threshold, as illustrated through the prolongation of the repolarization period after injecting TEA into the Japanese toad’s muscle that made it difficult to return the cell back to its resting potential [Hagiwara: 1955]. Without significent data it cannot be determined whether blocking the potassium from leaving the cell following depolarization truly causes the threshold for muscle contraction to increase, therefore we cannot confidently conclude that TEA would prevent species such as the Rania pipiens from responding appropriately to a stimulus that demands muscle contraction. However the hazardous capabilities of a high concentration of TEA presented by the Japanese toad experiment should still be considered [Hagiwara: 1955].
