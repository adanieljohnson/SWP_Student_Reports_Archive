Title: Effect of Sunlight on Biomass Allocation Patterns in Mung Bean Plants (Vigna radiata)

Abstract:
Plants learn to adapt to varying levels of sunlight, an abiotic factor, in order to survive in their environment. Mung bean plants (Vigna radiata) can allocate the majority of their energy toward either their roots or their shoots. This study focused on the effect of sunlight on root: shoot ratios and it was expected that plants in sunlight would have a higher proportion of shoots to roots. Mung bean plants were grown for two weeks and then the weights and lengths of each plant’s roots and shoots were individually recorded (in g and cm) to calculate the root: shoot ratio. The results show that plants in the sun had a larger average root: shoot ratio for weight than the plants in the shade. For length, it was also found that the plants in the sun had the higher root: shoot ratio compared to the plants in the shade. Plants in the sun had longer roots than shoots, while plants in the shade had longer shoots than roots. This does not support the hypothesis that plants in the shade will have a higher proportion of roots and plants in the sun will have a higher proportion of shoots. Plants in the sun may have focused more energy on growing roots since they already had a direct source of sunlight, while plants in the shade may have grown more shoots to reach the sunlight. 

Introduction:
Plants learn to adapt to both abiotic and biotic factors in order to survive in their environment. Abiotic and biotic factors can affect energy capture, fitness, and many other aspects of plant life [Johnson: 2018]. One example of an abiotic factor is the amount of sunlight a plant is exposed to. It is known that plants in shaded areas cannot have high photosynthetic rates, but they grow well at low light intensities. Plants in sun have higher photosynthetic rates, but their net rates are lower than plants in low light intensities [Boardman: 1977]. In a 2000 study on the effect of nutrient availability on biomass allocation patterns, it was found that natural selection has favored planned allocation strategies, rather than abrupt plastic responses to new environmental conditions [Müller: 2000]. This means that plants that have a genetically determined growth (or energy allocation) strategy will be better suited for survival in their environment than plants that are abruptly introduced to a new environment, such as shade or sun. This study will examine the resource allocation patterns of Mung Bean plants when an abiotic factor, sunlight, is introduced. It is hypothesized that plants in shade will have a higher proportion of roots and plants in sunlight will have a higher proportion of shoots. This is expected because plants in the shade will allocate more energy toward growing roots since they do not have a large source of sunlight to take up nutrients, while plants in the sun can gain more nutrients from sunlight since they have a large source of it. 


Materials and Method:
Mung bean seeds were soaked in a beaker of water for twenty-four hours prior to being planted. After soaking, the seeds were placed in black planters filled with vermiculite. Each planter was given 50 Ml water and 50 Ml Miracle Grow. Soil was placed on top of the seeds to cover them and each planter was labeled. Plants were grown over a period of two weeks in the Wake Forest Greenhouse. Two planters were placed in the shade (underneath a screen) and two were placed in sunlight. Plants were given 100 Ml water in each planter daily throughout the two-week growth period. After the growth period, plants were harvested by placing the planters in a 1-inch tub of water to soak off the vermiculite and isolate the plants. Twenty-four plants (12 sun and 12 shade) were then separated from the groups they were growing in. It is important to be sure not to break the roots while separating the plants since they will be used for measurements. Next, the roots were separated from the shoots using a pair of scissors. Roots and shoots for each plant were weighed (in grams) separately on a scale and the lengths were recorded in centimeters. Using these measurements, the root:shoot ratios for weight and for length were calculated by dividing the weight or length of the roots by the weight or length of the shoots. Averages and standard deviation values were calculated and a two-sample unpaired t_test was used for statistical analysis. 


Results:
The results showed that plants in the sun have a larger average root: shoot ratio for weight (Figure 1) than the plants in the shade (t_stat=3.028, d.f.=22, P=0.003). For length, it was also found that the plants in the sun had the higher root: shoot ratio (See Figure 2) compared to the plants in the shade (t_stat=3.609, d.f.=22, P=0.0008). Weights for plants in the sun and shade showed that on average, plants in the sun had higher weight values for their roots than plants in the shade. Lengths for plants in the sun are generally larger for the roots, while for plants in the shade, lengths were larger for the shoots than the roots (Table 1). 


Discussion:
The results showed that plants in the sun had a slightly larger average root weight and a slightly smaller average shoot weight than the plants in the shade (See Table 1). Plants in the sun had longer roots than shoots, while plants in the shade had longer shoots than roots. This does not support the hypothesis that plants in the shade will have a higher proportion of roots and plants in the sun will have a higher proportion of shoots. While the hypothesis was not supported, the plants in the sun may have had more roots because they did not need to grow toward the sun since they were already in direct sunlight. The plants in the shade had less sunlight, so they likely grew more shoots in order to reach the sunlight and obtain more energy. The results of this study are consistent with literature showing that plants in shade are still capable of growing efficiently and photosynthesizing at low light intensities [Boardman: 1977]. Most literature focuses on photosynthetic rates and overall biomass, but by measuring roots and shoots separately, much can be learned about energy allocation. In the future, this study may be improved by measuring both total plant biomass (in grams) and separate root and shoot measurements in order to better understand photosynthetic ability under varying light intensities and also energy allocation.
