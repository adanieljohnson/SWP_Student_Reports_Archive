Title: The Effect of Calcium Channel Blocker on Muscle Contractions in a Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Frog Leg

Abstract:
Like hormone-systems, animals use nerves and muscles to sense and respond to internal and external
environments. The chemical signals in these pathways allow for very fast response to stimuli. In many
organisms, the time from the sensation of a stimuli to the response can take milliseconds. Also,
in the neuromuscular pathways, motor neurons meet individual muscle fibers or myofibers at a
point called the neuromuscular junction. Electrical signals from motor neurons reach the neuromuscular
junction and prompt the release of further signals to activate a contraction in a muscle. This experiment
tests the neuromuscular controll in a frog leg, specifically the gastrocnemus or calf muscle and the
effects of a calcium blocker on muscle contractions. We hypothesized that the calcium channel blocker
would reduce the power of the muscle twitch compared to the muscle twitches in a muscle lacking the
drug.  After completing the experiment, we found that a calcium blocker, lanthanum chloride, did
reduce a response in the frog legs muscles by at least .045 V in each leg (more in legs 1&3). These
results did support our hypothesis, but the data shows that the difference in response from controll and
experimental is not statistically significent with a p_value of 0.187. This is possibly due to t

Introduction:
In most vertebrates, including humans, there are not only hormone-based systems but also chemical-based electrical systems in the body. These chemical-based systems can have signals that travel at very fast speeds. In the neuromuscular system, nerves and muscles work together to allow an organism to sense and respond to stimuli. To be more specific, they allow an organism to carry out the processes of sensation and perception. Due to electrical signals, a response can happen within a second. Additionally, in the neuromuscular pathways, motor neurons meet individual muscle fibers or myofibers at a point called the neuromuscular junction. Electrical signals from motor neurons reach the neuromuscular junction and prompt the release of further signals to activate a contraction in a muscle [Johnson:2016]. One of the necessary ions that aids in the production of a contraction is calcium. When calcium is absent or blocked at the neuromuscular junction, a muscle contraction will not occur; is release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is necessary for a contraction to occur [Richter: 1984]. This experiment will test the neuromuscular controll in a frog leg, specifically the gastrocnemus or calf muscle. Specifically, tension, contractions and length of a single twitch will be evaluated with and without the presence of a calcium channel blocker. I hypothesize that the chemical drug will decrease the power of the twitch compared to a muscle twitch without the chemical present in the neuromuscular pathways. The chemical drug inhibits calcium channels from functioning, so calcium won’t be released which will decrease or inhibit contraction in the leg muscle. 

Materials and Method:
Prepare a frog leg in a dissecting pan by peeling back the skin from the thigh muscle and remove the skin by pulling it towards the toes (then all the way off). Split the thigh muscle with a dissection probe. Locate the sciatic nerve (the white cord in muscle) and delicately free the nerve from the muscle. Be careful handling the nerve. The less is it traumatized or comes in contact with metal, the better. Be sure to keep exposed tissues moist with Ringer’s solution, but don’t drown them. Set up the leg by watching the video provided. Set the probes up so they are directly touching the sciatic nerve. Set up the online software by clicking the stimulator preferences icon on the Labscribe tool bar to open the stimulator controll panel on the Main Window. Check the values for the stimulus parameters that are listed in the simulator controll panel on the Main Window: Pulse amplitude should be set at 0.000V, number of pulses to 1, Frequency to 1, and pulse width to 5 ms. The value for the stimulus perimeter can be changed by clicking the arrow buttons to the right of the window that displays the value of the parameter to increase or decrease the value. Type 0.000V in the Mark box to the right of the Mark button. Click record to stimulate the nerve with 0.0 00V and press the Mark button to attach the comment to the recording. Apply a light load to the muscle by raising the force transducer with the tension adjuster until the trace moves a few mV above the baseline. Once a light load is applied, click stop. Change the stimulus amp to 0.1V and click the apply button to effect the change in amp. Type 0.1V in the Mark box and click record to stimulate the nerve with 0.1V and press the mark button to attach the comment to the recording. Stop as soon as the muscle twitches or after a few seconds. Repeat for 0.2-0.5V and then 1.0-3.0V. Record the response from the leg at each interval. After the first leg is done, inject .2 Ml lanthanum chloride into the leg using a syringe and wait 8 minutes for the solution to enter the muscle fibers. Repeat the same response process and record the results. Repeat for the other two legs, and graph the data collected to compare values of the controll and experimental responses at 3.0 amplitude. Then, enter your results into a paired t_test to test for significance.

Results:
The Frog legs all responded to the injection of lanthanum chloride when charged to force a muscle twitch as shown in Figure 1. All three of the controll legs had a larger response than the experimental legs although leg 2 had very similar responses in both controll (0.459 V) and experimental (0.418 V). Leg 1 had the most noticeable change in response between the controll and experimental but also had the largest response out of all three legs with a the controll response being 1.342 V and the experimental response being 0.864 V. Based on the data, there was a difference in response, but there wasn’t a statistically significent change in the response between controll and experimental with a p_value of 0.05 (p=.187). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the chemical drug, lanthanum chloride, will decrease the twitch response compared to a muscle twitch without the chemical present in the neuromuscular pathways is was not supported because our data was not significent. There is, however, a general trend in the data the supports our hypothesis. The data in Figure 1 shows a clear decrease in response when the drug was injected compared to the controll responses. Though the hypothesis is supported, the change in response is not statistically significent because the p_value (0.187) is much larger than 0.05. This issue could be a result of the data used in the t_test. In this experiment, it was necessary to use a form of raw data to make a conclusion about the experiment. This raw data could be a bad representation of all the data collected from the frog leg responses. In another experiment, it would be best to find a way to represent the data in a more well-rounded approach.  In the future, experimenters could use more frog legs and then average the responses specific to the data they choose to interpret in order to stray away from using raw data. Additionally, error might’ve been a part of this experiment because the difficulty in positioning the sciatic nerve across the probes, and the variable of repeated stimulation to a muscle with a limited supply of ATP. Since the ATP is limited, the leg can only twitch and respond to stimuli until the ATP is all used up. In a similar experiment, calcium inhibitors were used to test their effect on the vasodilation. The researchers found similar results to the experiment that we performed. These results concluded that calcium channel blockers inhibit the contraction by inhibiting some intracellular organelles [Cauvin: 1983]. Their evidence supports that calcium inhibitors function to inhibit plasmalemmal calcium channel that are activated by depolarization [Cauvin: 1983]. In future research, there could be a combination of these two experiments to help further understand the role of calcium in muscle contractions and the vascular system.
