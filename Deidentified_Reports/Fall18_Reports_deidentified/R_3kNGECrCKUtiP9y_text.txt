Title: Negative effects of caffeine on growth in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
The organism Polycephalum physarum is an extremely perceptive organism that is very easy to use in a laboratory.  By responding to chemical, light, and temperature stimuli, the organism organizes itself through second messenger cascades to respond appropriately.  The organism can mobilize to grow in a certain direction towards a positive stimulus or away from a negative stimulus.  External receptors interact with G coupled proteins that extend into the cell and activate a cascade of signaling through three main second messenger molecules – calcium, IP3 and cAMP.  This experiment tests the effects of caffeine on the growth of the organism.  It was hypothesized that caffeine would increase the growth.  Significant results showed that the presence of caffeine completely stops growth.  This phenomenon may be due to the exhaustive effects of caffeine on calcium in the cell, halting the messaging cascade to induce growth. 

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum, also known as the slime mold, has been utilized as a model organism for a wide range of advantages.  A large quantity of the organism is available for study, it easily responds to environmental changes such as light, and these changes are activated by a wide range of stimuli [Sauer: 1969].  This organism prefers a moist environment.  Sunlight is often a cue of a dry environment, so it is generally photophobic.  It also responds to chemical stimuli, causing both aversive and positive behavior depending on the chemical identity.  The reactive behaviors of Physarum polycephalum observe all of the environmental stimuli, balancing advantages and risk factors before taking action [Latty:2010].  To perceive the external stimuli, the slime mold uses receptors on the cell surface that are chemical, voltage gated or photo sensitive.  Using G protein coupled receptors, the internal environment of the cell is notified of external changes and can initiate appropriate responses.  Second messenger molecules, such as cAMP, Ca2+, and IP3, are used to carry on this chemical cascade.  Other molecules and systems are in place to observe external stimuli, though these are the three main molecules used [lab manual].  

In the presence of no chemicals on an agar plate, physarum will grow aiMlessly, attempting to find a source of energy.  When a chemical stimulus is introduced, depending on its identity, it will create an aversive or positive reaction in the organism.  The chemicals are perceived by the cell through either ligand binding or voltage sensitive receptors on the external membrane [Aldrich:2012].  Interestingly, the response of the physarum to light depends on which kind of light is present.  When blue light is presented in the range of 490nm, the organism has an aversive response.  In the presence of red light at 650nm, a positive growth response is observed.  Additionally, once a threshold of light magnitude is reached, the growth does not correlate with how much light is present [Durham: 1976].

Because the slime mold can have varying responses to chemicals in different environments, this experiment attempts to limit as many variables as possible to isolate the reaction to solely in response to caffeine.  This experiment will test the effects of caffeine concentrations on the growth of Physarum polycephalum.  The organism will be placed in two different environments of caffeine concentration and the growth after four days will be observed.  It is hypothesized that growth will proportionally increase with caffeine concentration increase.  


Materials and Method:
Nine PDA (potato dextrose agar) plates were obtained and labeled as controll, 1X, or 2X.  1X and 2X caffeine concentrations were created by diluting a concentrated caffeine source with deionized water.  In the three plates labeled “1X”, approximately 10Ml of the 1X caffeine concentration was poured into each.  The same was done for the three “2X” plates.  After 10 minutes of soaking, the caffeine concentrations were put into waste and paper towels were used to dab any extra liquid from the rim of the plates.  
	
In the immediate center of each plate, using a metal blade, a single 1 cm3 agar block was removed and disposed of.  In its place, one equal sized cube of agar containing slime mold was placed.  Between each cut, the blade was sterilized using ethanol.  Once complete, each of the plate’s edges were taped and placed into a black, sun blocking bag and put into an incubator.  After four days, the plates were checked for growth of the slime mold.  After 4 days, the program Image J was used to quantify the growth on each plate.  A one-way Anova test was run to determine statistical significance. 


Results:
Growth was observed in each of the three controll plates.  No growth was observed in the 1X nor 2X caffeine concentration containing plates.  The One Way Anova statistical test used resulted in a p_value of 0.000193, compared against an alpha value of 0.05, indicating significent results.  Both of the 1X and 2X groups were significent when compared against the controll group.  

Discussion:
The pathway of caffeine in regulating growth is not well defined and its presence often leads to different results.  This means that caffeine can affect a cell in more than one way, depending on the intracellular environment.  Caffeine can have a positive effect on growth.  It does this by decreasing the release of Ca2+ in the cell.  Ca2+ acts to convert cAMP to a non-functional form.  When less Ca2+ is present, more cAMP is available to activate PKAs in the cell.  PKAs are crucial to growth.  When more are active, more growth can occur [Horrigan:2004].  

It was hypothesized that the addition of calcium to the environment would result in increased growth, based on the pathway described above.  As was exhibited in the results section, no growth was seen in any of the experimental trials, yet growth was observed in the controll groups.  As the results were significent with a p_value of 0.000193, the hypothesis was deemed false.  

A study conducted in 2001 explored how a depletion of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum affects function.  It was found that when calcium stores are depleted, the muscle experiences fatigue and can no longer perform tasks [Allen: 2001].  This underlying principle can be related to Physarum polycephalum.  Because caffeine affects the concentrations of calcium in the cell, it is possible that its presence depletes these stores.  With no calcium available to the organism, growth cannot be initiated as the second messenger molecule, calcium, is not present. 

Caffeine has been found to inhibit cAMP.  Because it is an important molecule in signaling pathways, the ability to disallow it to function can be utilized to investigate other molecule’s functions.  By recording the effects of a nonfunctional cAMP, more can be learned about this pathway and others.  Future experiments can draw on caffeine’s negative effects on cAMP concentrations to learn more about cell signaling pathways [Brenner: 1984].
