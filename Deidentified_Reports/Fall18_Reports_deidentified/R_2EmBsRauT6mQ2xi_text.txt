Title: Nitrogen’s Effect on Resource Allocation in the Roots and Shoots of Pisum sativun

Abstract:
	Pisum sativun, a plant known for its resource allocation abilities, was studied to find the effects of nitrogen on the allocation of resources to the roots and shoots of the plant. The importance of this experiment is to see how nitrogen from runoff may affect plant growth. We grew Pisum sativun in a nitrogen rich environment and in a controll environment and then compared the root-shoot ratios from each. After running statistical tests on the data, we found that there is support that nitrogen effects root and shoot length in Pisum sativun.

Introduction:
	In an ecological community, plants and animals interact with and adapt to one another as biotic factors that produce stimuli in their shared environment. Another type of stimuli, abiotic factors, must also be adapted to. These include stimuli of non-biological origin, such as sunlight, wind, and temperature. These resources are finite and plants and animals must compete for them. This resources limitation affects what species are present in a community. Organisms can only extract a finite amount of resources from their environment because, any species capable to out compete all others in every environment would need more resources than the planet can offer, and because an organism needs to spend resources to get resources.
	Leaves are the primary photosynthetic plant organ. Increased resource allocation to the leaves, meaning that resources were spent to make leaves larger, would lead to higher growth rates when light and soil nutrients are in high quantity. Stems also help in the accumulation of light because they allow the plant to grow above other plants preventing the shade from other leaves from blocking out the sun. Roots anchor the plant in the soil and allow for nutrient and water absorption. Plants that grow in environments with little rainfall will have longer roots due to the need to find more water. This sort of resource allocation is seen in Pisum sativun in situations of root avoidance where roots sense, using chemical markers, that they are growing towards an obstacle so the plants use less resources by not growing roots in that direction [Kerkez: 2005]. 
	Nitrogen is important in plant growth. It assists in chlorophyll creation, which is the driving force of photosynthesis. Plants need to absorb nitrogen through their roots. In an experiment with Bromus molius, plants in high nitrogen environments could allocate more resources to photosynthetic shoots to uptake more energy through photosynthesis [Larigauderie: 1988]. My hypothesis is that Pisum sativun with extra nitrogen in their soil, will allocate less resources to their roots compared to a controll group of field peas. This is because the Pisum sativun in nitrogen rich soil will need less root mass to get nitrogen because it is readily available. This would mean that root-shoot ratios will be less for nitrogen rich Pisum sativun because by avoiding the allocation of resources to their roots, the plants can put more resources into stem and leaf growth for photosynthesis.

Materials and Method:
We grew Pisum sativun under two separate conditions, one in a controll setting and the other in nitrogen rich soil. The controll setting received only water once a day, while the experimental setting received a nitrogen solution once a day. We then measured the mass and lengths of the roots and shoots of 12 Pisum sativun of each group and calculated their average root-shoot ratios. We then calculated the standard deviations, degrees of freedom, t-value, and 2-tailed p_value for both the length and mass averages.

Results:
It was found that the average root-shoot ratios were higher in the controll group, both for mass and length variables, compared to the experimental group which received the nitrogen solution.The Pisum sativun in the nitrogen solution had shorter roots and longer stems compared to the controll group. The significance of the variations in mass between the two groups was not great (t_stat = 0.97, d.f. = 22, 2-tailed P = 0.34). However, the variation in length between the two groups was significent (t_stat = 4.49, d.f. = 22, 2-tailed P = 0.00018).


Discussion:
The data shows that Pisum sativun in a high nitrogen environment allocate less resources to root growth than Pisum sativun grown in a lower nitrogen environment. This supports my hypothesis. This is because plants in less nitrogen rich soil must grow longer roots to gather up more nitrogen compared to those in environments where nitrogen is readily available. Nitrogen rich plants placed more of a focus on shoot growth.

Figure 1. Average mass ratio and length ratio of experimental and controll Pisum sativun. The controll group’s root-shoot ratios are higher than the experimental group that received the nitrogen solution. The standard deviations for the controll group are roughly the same for average mass and length ratios. The standard deviation for the average mass ratio in the nitrogen rich environment was very large while much smaller in the average length ratio.
