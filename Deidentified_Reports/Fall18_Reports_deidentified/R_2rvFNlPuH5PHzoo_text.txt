Title: Effect of pH on Photosynthetic Activity in the Hill Reaction of Photosynthesis

Abstract:
This experiment measured the rate of photosynthetic reduction by making enhanced chloroplasts and altering the pH of their solution to see how this changes photosynthetic rate, measuring photosynthetic rate via absorbances. A lower absorbance means higher photosynthetic rate. We will specifically observe the Hill Reaction, which is a process of electron transport in the presence of chloroplasts in light. This experiment will test chloroplasts in natural light under pH 3 and pH 5 conditions. We hypothesized that the pH 5 solution would result in higher photosynthetic activity. The results of our experiment supported the hypothesis, showing a lower absorbance for the test tubes with the pH 5 solution and therefore a higher photosynthetic rate. 

Introduction:
	All living organisms undergo a process that extracts energy from external sources. Mainly plants, animals, protists, and some bacteria use photosynthesis, which harvests energy from light. This light energy is stored and released via glycolysis in the cytoplasm of the cell [Barth, 2015]. There is also a process called respiration, which occurs in the mitochondria of all organisms. Both photosynthesis and respiration undergo REDOX reactions, which is when electrons are transferred through a system called an electron transport chain from one molecular complex to the next [Chaudhry, Bhimji, 2018]. They both generate a proton gradient which then drives other processes. In this lab, we will observe the Hill Reaction, which is a process of electron transport in the presence of chloroplasts in light [OCR, 2016]. We will measure the rate of photosynthetic reduction by making enhanced chloroplasts and altering the pH of their solution to see how this changes photosynthetic rate. 

Materials and Method:
	We will use the same method from last week to prepare spinach extract using the grinding buffer [Johnson, 2018].  After the solution is made, transfer it into a centrifuge tube and spin it for 10 minutes. Then, pour out supernatant into a separate centrifuge tube. Spin this for 10 minutes, then pour out that supernatant into another tube, leaving the pellet in its original tube. Suspend the pellet with normal grinding buffer, then separate this mixture equally into 3 tubes. Add 4 Ml of pH 3 buffer to one centrifuge tube, 4 Ml of pH 5 buffer to another centrifuge tube, and 4 Ml more of grinding buffer to the last centrifuge tube. This tube will serve as the controll. Spin these for 10 minutes. Re-suspend each pellet with 20 Ml grinding buffer after pouring out the supernatant. Transfer 100 microliters from each of the three centrifuge tubes, separated into three sections of 3 test tubes, leaving 1 test tube empty of chloroplasts to serve as the blank (10 tubes in all). Add 6Ml of distilled water to all tubes except for the blank, adding 8 Ml to that tube. Add 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP to all tubes except the blank. Add 2Ml of reaction buffer to all tubes. Allow each tube to sit for 10 minutes and measure absorbance. Repeat this waiting period twice, so absorbances are recorded again at 20 and 30 minutes.

Results:
Our results supported our hypothesis that the pH 5 solution would have the highest photosynthetic activity. Figure one shows the photosynthetic activity over time, which was measured at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. This figure shows that the pH 5 solution has a decreasing trend in absorbance, which means it has an increasing rate of photosynthetic activity, supporting our hypothesis. Figure two shows the percent changes over time for photosynthetic activity, and the pH 5 solution has the lowest difference in percent change over time which also supports our hypothesis.

Discussion:
	Since a lower absorbance means that the chloroplasts were more active and therefore had a higher photosynthetic activity, we round that the pH 5 solution had higher photosynthetic activity. We know this because the DCIP, when reduced, is colorless [University of Hawaii, 2017]. In photosynthesis and specifically the Hill Reaction, REDOX reactions occur which results in a reduced product. Since the DCIP is colorless when it is reduced, we can believe that the chloroplasts were active and that there was high photosynthetic activity because the solution had a low absorbance because it was colorless. However, our p_value for our results was 0.616, which tells us that our results are statistically insignificent. This could be due to the fact that we measured absorbance at T-10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes instead of T-0 minutes, 10 minutes, and 20 minutes. This could also be due to not waiting long enough between measuring absorbances. There is clearly discrepancy in the pH 3 values in both figures one and two, which would explain the p_value. However, our results for the pH 5 solutions lead us to believe that, upon repeating this experiment with more accuracy, our results could be statistically significent for pH 3.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Photosynthetic activity over time. This graph shows photosynthetic activity over time, which was measured by absorbances of the solution with the mitochondria. This graph shows that, over 30 minutes, the pH 5 solution is most similar to the controll and that the photosynthetic activity decreased over time. 

Figure 2: Photosynthetic activity percent changes over time. This graph shows the difference in percent change over time 10-30 minutes. As seen in the figure, pH 3 had the highest difference in percent change and pH 5 had the least difference. *************************************************************************
