Title: The Effects of 2% of Sevin on Muscle Amplitude

Abstract:
Rana Pipiens frogs rely on the contraction of their gastrocnemius muscle to move. When a change in the calcium level or an action potential does not occur, the gastrocnemius muscle fails to contract the amount required for the intended movement. In this lab, 2% of Sevin was injected into the gastrocnemius of the frog leg. It was hypothesized that the addition of 2% of Sevin in the gastrocnemius would cause increase in the twitch frequency and would ultimately lead to tetany at a lower amplitude. Data did not show a significant difference between the control and experimental frog legs. The experimental frog legs failed to reach tetany at a lower amplitude than the control frog legs. The hypothesis was not supported by the results of the experiment. 

Introduction:
Muscles contract when neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, are released into the neurotransmitter junction and bind to the post synaptic muscle fiber. The binding creates an action potential that spreads throughout the muscle and causes the muscle myosin to bind to actin which ultimately results in muscle contraction. Another aspect to muscle contraction is the effect calcium has on the body. When calcium is released into the cytoplasm, it binds with troponin, allowing the myosin binding site to be exposed and ultimately allows the myosin to bind with the actin [Endo:1968]. Calcium is then taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing relaxation of the muscle [Endo:1968]. In the lab, the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve of a frog under the injection of 2% of Sevin was examined. 2% of Sevin is a chemical insecticide naphthyl methylcarbamate [Endo:1968]. It is commonly used to exterminate pests because it has a powerful effect on their nervous systems and ultimately leads to their death. The biological question investigated was whether or not 2% of Sevin would cause the muscle to twitch more frequently and reach tetany at a lower stimulus amplitude. In order to answer this question the effects of stimulus frequency on twitch amplitude was investigated. It is hypothesized that when 2% of Sevin solution is injected into frog legs, the muscle will twitch more frequently and reach tetany at a lower amplitude. 

Materials and Methods:
In the experiment three frog legs were used. Before the control and experimental tests were run on the frog legs, the frog legs had to be dissected in order to expose the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve. The skin of the frog was peeled back exposing the gastrocnemius muscle. Then, the gastrocnemius muscle was separated from the connective tissue by running a pair of scissors between the muscles. To reveal the sciatic nerve, the gastrocnemius muscle was separated from the connective tissue by cutting through the tendon distal towards the Achilles tendon. After exposing both the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve, a 30 cm long piece of thread was used to tie a knot around the muscle. Once the thread was tied, it was placed on a hook on the arm of the force transducer so that that the gastrocnemius muscle could be suspended. Metal pins were then placed in locations around the frog leg to ensure the frog leg would be held down and controlled during contractions. The sciatic nerve was placed on top of the electrode to ensure maximum stimulation from the amplifier. Electrical data gathered from the sciatic nerve is computed and displayed as a myogram which then allows us to measure the twitches in the muscle cell during stimulation.  After completion of dissection, control data was gathered from each frog leg. This data was gathered by stimulating the sciatic nerve for short periods of stimulus frequencies (2,4,10,15,20 and 25 Hz). For every new stimulation frequency, the number of pulses was set to zero, the pulse amplitude remained at 1.0 A, and the pulse width was set to 5 ms. After data was gathered from at each stimulus frequency, observations and distance between peaks of the twitches was recorded. An indication that the frog leg has reached tetany is that the distance between the peaks of the twitches in ms reads 0 ms.  This control procedure was run on all three frog legs. After the control procedures were run, the experimental procedure began. The experimental procedure was similar to the control procedure in the fact that data was gathered in the same manner. The distance between the control and the experimental procedure is that all three gastrocnemius muscles were injected with 0.1 mL of 2% of Sevin solution before tests were run. To analyze the data gathered, a paired t-test was performed on the averages of the control and experimental data to determine whether or not injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with 2% of Sevin created statistically significant data.

Results:
Overall, the control frog legs had normal results and observations as frequency was increased. The experimental frog legs also displayed similar results as the frequency was increased. The results first began displaying temporal summation and then slowly reached tetany. The experimental frog legs also began to display temporal summation for the first few increases in tetany (2-10 Hz) but were unable to reach tetany. In the control frog legs, 25 Hz stimulations brought 2/3 of the frog legs to complete tetany. This did not hold true in the experimental frog legs. In the experimental frog legs, at 25 Hz, the average distance between the twitches was 40 ms. In figure 1, the data did not provide sufficient information to conclude that 2% of Sevin caused a significant decrease in the distance between muscle contractions as the frequency increased. The experimental test conducted to determine the statistical significance of injecting the frog legs with 2% of Sevin solution was a paired t test. The average distance between twitches in ms with a 0.1 mL of 2% of sevin injection was not statistically different from the control group (t-stat=0.995, df=6, P=0.357512).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that 2% of Sevin solution would cause an increase in the twitch of the gastrocnemius muscle and ultimately lead it to reach tetany at a lower amplitude was not supported. The hypothesis was rejected because the statistically insignificant result was greater than .05. This means that the results gathered after injected the frog leg with 2% of Sevin could have occurred by chance. Since the results show that the times between twitches in ms at different frequencies was not statistically different between the control and experimental frog legs, it cannot be concluded that 2% of Sevin solution causes the leg to reach tetany at a lower amplitude.  The control frog legs were able to reach complete tetany by 25 Hz but the experimental frog legs remained at incomplete tetany at 25 Hz. Based off previously conducted experiments, it was believed that 2% of Sevin interferes with the venous fluid which helps conduct action potentials created by the stimulation of the motor fibers in voluntary muscles [Dale:1936].  Although our data does not support this statement based off previously conducted experiments, it still may be true. Possible reasons our experiment did not align with other similar experiments could be due to the fact that the frog legs may have been fatigued from the control trails or that the 2% of Sevin may not have been evenly distrusted throughout the whole gastrocnemius muscle. In the future, if the experiment were to be run again, the experiment should be conducted by injecting a greater amount of 2% of Sevin into the gastrocnemius muscle and allowing a longer resting period between the control and the experimental trails.
