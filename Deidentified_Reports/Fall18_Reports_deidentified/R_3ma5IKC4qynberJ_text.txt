Title: The Effect of Diuron on Photosynthetic Activity on Spinach Leaves 

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to understand how diuron would affect the electron transport chain within photosystem II within the chloroplast in spinach leaves. We tested this through 3 variable groups, our control (no chloroplast), our positive control (chloroplast in light), and lastly our experimental (chloroplast in light plus diuron). We understand that diuron is an inhibitor and effects photosystem II by blocking the reuptake of electrons preventing photosynthetic activity. With this in mind it is hypothesized that there will be a significant difference between our positive control and our experimental group because our positive control will produce photosynthetic activity, have a change in absorbance whereas our experimental group will not because of inhibition (no change in absorbance).

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to evaluate how the electron pathway of spinach leaves,Spinacia oleracea is effected because of diuron. Diuron is a urea herbicide that is absorbed through plant roots, but we didn’t use roots within our lab, and then translocated to the aerial parts when applied to soil surrounding the plants making it a herbicide used for agricultural and nonagricultural weed control [Jin et al., 2016]. Diuron “is heavily used in areas adjacent to estuaries” [Williams, Carranza, Kunzelman,Datta, & Kuivila., 2008]. Implicating that there could be more effects than just to the photosystem of the plants affected but to also the ecosystems around these plants.  Diuron inhibits the reduction of NADP+ that is required for CO_2 fixation by blocking photosystem II’s electron transfer from the primary accepter to the secondary acceptor [Jin et ., 2016]. Photosystem II of green plants oxidizes water and reduces plastoquinone, when inhibitors prevent binding there is a reduction of photosynthesis [Venlthuys, 1981]. Diuron blocks the electron flow from photosystem II preventing the binding of electrons to advance photosynthesis. We also used DCPIP, that works as an electron acceptor allowing electrons to carry through the process, this is in our experiement because we measured absorbance instead of growth of a physical plant. 
We will study this through enriching chloroplasts with centrifugation and then isolating 3 samples of those chloroplasts in different conditions such as our negative control- no chloroplast, positive control- chloroplast in light, and our experimental- chloroplast in light plus diuron. We will then measure absorbance of each sample to determine the affect of photosynthetic activity, whether it was reduced or not. 
We are measuring the change in absorbance relative to our positive control and our experimental (chloroplast plus diuron and light). In terms of seeing the impact of diuron, we expect diuron to inhibit photosynthetic activity. Our positive control serves to represent what should offur when photosynthesis is activated and light induced electron transfers and reuptake within DCPIP. DCPIP exhibits a blue hue and when electron reuptake is activated the blue hue turns clear this means that absorbance would decrease. Because diuron will prevent DCPIP from accepting electrons therefore interrupting the cycle and leading to a no change in absorbance, as if no chloroplast was in the solution. Therefore, I hypothesize that there will be a statistical significance of plus chloroplast with diuron and the positive control because photosynthetic activity would be inhibited


Materials and Methods:
We placed a mortar and pestle, medium-sized beaker (150-250 mL size), two 50mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the materials were cooling we removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves. Then threw away the veins away and rinsed the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. We then blotted off the excess moisture from the leaves.  When the mortar & pestle were cold we wiped them off and dryed and then added the spinach leaves. Then we added 10mL of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to the mortar. We then grinded the spinach with the buffer until it was a thick paste with no large chunks left, added an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer and then mixed it to a spinach slurry. Then we strained the entire volume of the green slurry through 3 layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. Then transferred the green liquid into a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “A” and then spun it at 200 X G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. We made sure to properly balance the centrifuge with balance tubes. Once that was done, we poured the supernatant out of the marked “A” into a second chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “B”. We made sure not to transfer the debris at the bottom of the tube “A”. Then we centrifuged the 50 mL tube containing chloroplast suspension ( Tube “B”) at 1,000 X G (2800 rpm in RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Added 20 mL of the grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. We saved all materials at the end of this exercise to use for the second part. We labeled 10 large test tubes, blank and 1-10 then placed them on a  tube rack. Then we turned on the spectrophotometer and set it to read at 600nm. We made three replicates of each of the following reaction mixes. Our control which had, 8mL water, 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, ph 6.5). Our 3 negative controls (labeled 1-3) had no chloroplast, 6mL of water,  2mL of DCPOP, 2mL of reaction buffer. Our positive controls (labeled 4-6) had our chloroplast, 6mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP, 2mL of reaction buffer. Our experimental sample ( 7-9) had our chloroplast, 5mL of water, 2mL of DCPIP, 2mL of reaction buffer and lastly 505 uL of diuron.  The following is how we added our chloroplast to the test tubes. We added the 100uL of the enriched chloroplasts prepared in Exercise 1 to all of the test tubes but the blank test tube. Then we mixed each tube immediately after adding DCPIP and the buffer by swirling the tube. Then we transferred the mixture to the spectrophotometer cuvettes. We blanked the spectrophotometer at 600 nm with the blank tube, then measured each sample and place the tubes back under light. After 10 minutes, we blanked the spectrophotometer with our blank and read and recorded each absorbance of each sample at 600 nm.  We placed the samples that needed to be under light back under the lamp (light). After 10 more minutes (20 minutes), we blanked the spectrophotometer. Then measure the absorbance a second time for all samples and placed them back in their proper places. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes) we blanked the spectrophotometer and measured the absorbances for all samples and record the data. We recorded our data on an excel sheet and then used a 2 sample 1 tailed t-test of equal variance in order to determine significance amongst our experimental and positive control (with chloroplast and light).

Results:
According to Figure 1, no chloroplast started off at 0.34 absorbance and then ended at 0.35 absorbance. Our positive control, plus chloroplast started at 0.28 and ended at 0.01. The plus chloroplast in light and plus herbicide started at 0.44 and 0.4 absorbance. The error for chloroplast in light was small compared to plus chloroplast in light and plus diuron, with a standard deviation +0.88 and -0.88. The 2 tailed t-test value comparing chloroplast in light vs. chloroplast in light plus diuron was as concluded(t-stat=14.53, df=3, p=0.00013). 

Discussion:
The purpose of this lab was to analyze the electron pathway of photosynthesis under different variables but focusing on how diuron would affect the electron pathway of spinach leaves. Based on our t-test results our hypothesis was supported. The 2 tailed t-test between our positive control and our experimental concluded a p-value of 0.0002495 meaning that there was a significant difference because the value was less than the set value of 0.05. Concluding, that there was a significant difference amongst the change in absorbance between our positive control that had the chloroplast under light and chloroplast with light plus diuron. Also supporting our prior research that diuron would in fact inhibit the electron transport chain from continuing it’s process. 
Chloroplast in light, went from an absorbance of 0.28 to 0.01 after 30 minutes under light. This supports our research that DCPIP worked and accepted the electron transfer continuing the process of photosynthesis. Plus chloroplast in light plus our diuron went from an absorbance of 0.44 to 0.40, this showed little to no difference in absorbance meaning that DCPIP, photosystem II, was blocked and its process stopped. Leading to the little to no change in absorbance reading. Our standard deviations for all our results were significantly low meaning that our averages of each sample are reliable and had little variation amongst the samples. 
This is different than some studies using diuron as an inhibitor on complete photosynthetic growth. For example, a study exposed their subject, they used full leaves to also measure structural changes, to diuron for 90 days whereas we only exposed the chloroplasts to diuron for a duration of 30 minutes and didn’t see how diuron would affect physical leaves. Had we continued exposure we could have potentially seen a reduction in absorbance. Their results concluded that “the effective PSII quantum yield had drastically reduced resulting in the complete inhibition at the higher dose… Similarly, the electron transport rate was also completely paralyzed in the same conditions” [de Lima et al., 2017]. Their experiment also resulted in the leaf surfaces and structure showing progressive damage with increased dosage. This concluded that the plants did not in fact grow and that photosynthesis was inhibited. They also didn’t use absorbance as a measurement for photosynthesis which is something that we could have done differently in our experiment.  For future experiments we could also experiment with the concentration of the herbicide and measure the reduction of photosynthesis in other ways. 
This experiment serves to demonstrate the effects of a herbicide that is used in bigger settings such as crop control and in daily agricultural workings. Diuron can also have greater effects to ecosystems when used, “In northeastern Australia identified high levels of diuron as the likely cause of a massive mangrove die-off” [Williams, Carranza, Kunzelman,Datta, & Kuivila., 2008]. This can have a major effect to the whole ecosystem other than just the plant that is being affected. This can show that diuron has a bigger effect in our ecosystem and in order to understand its full effects it benefits from understanding the point of lethal dosage and not just inhibition. Therefore, for future experiments it can be important to study how diuron can affect other plants and mammals.
