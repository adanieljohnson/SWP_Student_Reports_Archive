Title: Measuring the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol in Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea leaves showed that the variability in type of plant does not affect the reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. 

Abstract:
While measuring the reduction rate of NADP+ is difficult, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol has been shown to serve as an alternate electron acceptor to measure the rate of electron transport in photosynthesis. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the type of green plant on reduction reactions required for photosynthesis through measuring the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol. In a previous experiment, we determined that light conditions result in increased electron transport rates in comparison to dark conditions for Spinacia oleracea, which proved true in this experiment as well for both Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea. However, through measuring the absorbance values of each sample over time using a spectrophotometer, we found that the type of plant, particularly its leaf thickness, does not play a large role in reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. A paired t-test indicates that the results are not significant since the p-value is not less than 0.05. However, we found possible biological explanations, such as the presence of too many chloroplasts in the Brassica oleracea var. sabellica sample, that provide insight into the insignificant results generated in this experiment. 

Introduction:
In order to occur, many cellular processes need a source of energy, which can be obtained from three primary sources: chemical energy stored in covalent bonds, energy stored as oxidation-reduction potential, or an electrical or chemical gradient across a lipid bilayer [Johnson: 2018]. Plants capture and store energy through photosynthesis. A three-stage process that takes place in chloroplasts, it consists of light-dependent reactions and light-dependent reactions. The light-dependent reactions involve photosystems that absorb light to harvest energy, specifically producing ATP and NADPH [Johnson: 2018]. The light-independent reactions contain RUBSCO, an enzyme complex that then uses the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to form glucose [Johnson: 2018]. As a whole, photosynthesis can be summarized by the equation 6CO₂ + 12H₂O  C₂H₁₂O₆ + 6H₂O + 6O₂  [Johnson: 2018].  Photosynthesis also requires light, chlorophyll, Mn²⁺ ions, electron transport complexes, and a phospholipid bilayer [Johnson: 2018]. A recent study examined how factors, such as carbon dioxide concentration, can have a different effect on photosynthesis for different types of plants [Erwin: 2017]. This study concluded that Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea had varying CO₂ compensation points due to a difference in their composition [Erwin: 2017]. The Spinacia oleracea CO₂ compensation point was lower than that of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, indicating that some environmental factors do play a role in the rate of photosynthesis [Erwin: 2017]. In taking this information into account, our experimental question is does the type of green plant, specifically the thickness of a green plant’s leaves, affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis? In this experiment, we will use the leaves of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea – due to their accessibility and affordability – to test the effect of plant leaf thickness on the rate of electron transfer in photosynthesis. While determining ATP production in photosynthesis can be difficult, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) has been shown to serve as an alternate electron acceptor to measure the rate of electron transfer [Johnson: 2018]. As 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol accepts electrons and is reduced, it changes color from a blue compound to a colorless one [Johnson: 2018]. The goal of this experiment is to measure and analyze how the rate of electron transport varies between different types of green plants. We will accomplish this goal through evaluating the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol by measuring the transmittance of light and determining the absorbance values for the samples. We will use a control group with Spinacia oleracea leaves in light condition, as it has been shown to have many chloroplasts, and an experimental group with Brassica oleracea var. sabellica leaves in light condition. The reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, observed as a color change, will serve as the dependent variable and the type of plant – Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea – will serve as the true independent variable. We predict that Brassica oleracea var. sabellica will have a higher rate of electron transport in photosynthesis than Spinacia oleracea because Brassica oleracea var. sabellica has a thicker leaf. The increased thickness of the leaf means it has more intercellular space that can be filled with additional mesophyll cells (specialized for photosynthesis), indicating that more chloroplasts are present. Therefore, we predict that the greater the number of chloroplasts available to absorb light, the more light that is captured and converted into energy. As a result, in relation to the electron transport chain, we predict that there would be an increase in the rate of reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, suggesting that photosynthesis has been carried out more in Brassica oleracea var. sabellica leaves than Spinacia oleracea leaves and more in Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea in light conditions versus dark conditions. Thus, there would be a significant percent change in absorbance values, especially for Brassica oleracea var. sabellica leaves in comparison to Spinacia oleracea leaves.  

Materials and Methods:
For the first part of the experiment, we enriched chloroplasts using differential centrifugation, a method that isolates organelles from cells. We selected and removed the large central veins from four medium-sized Spinacia oleracea leaves and four medium-sized Brassica oleracea var. sabellica leaves, which an instructor obtained from an outside source for the experiment. Using a dry, chilled mortar and pestle, we grinded the Spinacia oleracea leaves with 10 mL of 400mM sucrose in Tricine pH 8.0 grinding buffer. Once the mixture reached a thick consistency, we added an additional 10 mL of 400mM sucrose in Tricine pH 8.0 grinding buffer, continuing to mix the semiliquid mixture and then straining it through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled, medium-sized beaker. We repeated these steps for Brassica oleracea var. sabellica as well. After straining the semiliquid mixture, we transferred 200 μl of the filtered liquid from the beaker of Spinacia oleracea into a microtube labeled “Sample of A – Spinach” and stored it on ice. We subsequently transferred the remaining green liquid from “Sample of A – Spinach” to a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “A – Spinach,” and spun it at 200 x G (1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for three minutes at four degrees Celsius. Then, we poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A - Spinach” into the second chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “B – Spinach,” without transferring the debris. Removing 200 μl of the liquid from the 50 mL tube marked “B – Spinach,” we placed it in a microtube labeled “Sample of B – Spinach” and put it on ice. Following this step, we centrifuged the 50 mL tube containing chloroplast suspension at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for ten minutes at four degrees Celsius. Once centrifuged, we poured the contents into a clean 50 mL tube marked “C – Spinach,” ensuring that we did not disturb the pellet. Next, we added 20 mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet, transferring 200 μl of this resuspended pellet into a microtube labeled “Sample of B Pellet – Spinach.” Lastly, we removed 200 μl from the tube labeled “C - Spinach,” and placed it into a microtube labeled “Sample of C - Spinach.” We repeated all of these steps for Brassica oleracea var. sabellica respectively. 

In the second component of the experiment, we quantified the reduction activity in photosynthesis using a spectrophotometer, a device set at 600 nanometers for our experiment to measure the intensity of light. To begin, we selected 17 large test tubes and placed them in a rack. We prepared one Spinacia oleracea blank (tube #1) and one Brassica oleracea var. sabellica blank (tube #2), which consisted of 8mL of water and 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5). In addition to the blanks, we prepared three replicates of no chloroplasts or the negative control (tubes #1-3), Spinacia oleracea in light conditions (tubes #6-8), Spinacia oleracea in dark conditions (tubes #9-11), Brassica oleracea var. sabellica in light conditions (tubes #12-14), and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica in dark conditions (tubes #15-17). We prepared these reaction mixtures by adding 6 mL of water, 2mL of 130mM 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, and 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5) to each test tube. To begin the assay, we added 100 μl of Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts to test tube #1 and tubes #6-11, and 100 μl of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica chloroplasts to test tube #2 and tubes #12-17. We transferred these mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes and blanked the spectrophotometer at 600 nanometers using tube #1 for Spinacia oleracea samples and tube #2 for Brassica oleracea var. sabellica samples, recording the absorbances for each subsequent tube. We then placed tubes #1-8 and #12-14 in lamp light, and tubes #9-11 and #15-17 in a dark cabinet. We re-recorded the absorbances of the tubes after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes for Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica.

For statistical analysis, a two-sample t-test was employed to compare the control group, Spinacia oleracea in light conditions, to the experimental group, Brassica oleracea var. sabellica in light conditions, analyzing whether the variance in plant type had an effect on the reduction reactions required for photosynthesis.

Results:
Based on examination of the data, it can be seen that the absorbance of chloroplasts in the control group (blue) decreased over time, whereas the absorbance of the experimental group (orange) was variable over time (Figure 1). Specifically, the absorbance of the experimental group initially increased from zero to ten minutes, subsequently decreased from ten to twenty minutes, and then slightly increased from twenty to thirty minutes (Figure 1). The standard deviation for Spinacia oleracea is 0.104 and the standard deviation for Brassica oleracea var. sabellica is 0.144. The t-value is 1.171, the degrees of freedom is 4, and the p-value is 0.307 for Spinacia oleracea in light and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica in light at time 30 minutes. Also, in evaluating the data, the percent change in absorbance values from time zero to thirty minutes was larger for light conditions for both Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica in comparison to dark conditions. 

Discussion:
Prior to this experiment, we learned that photosynthesis, a combination of light-dependent and light-independent reactions, is the process in which plants capture and store energy. Therefore, we predicted that the variability of a type of plant, specifically the thickness of the plant’s leaves, would have an important impact on the reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. We hypothesized that Brassica oleracea var. sabellica would have a higher rate of electron transport than Spinacia oleracea and that there would be a greater percent change in absorbance values for light conditions versus dark conditions.

Based on a previous experiment we conducted on the effect of environmental conditions on the rate of electron transport in photosynthesis, we chose “Sample of B Pellet – Spinach” and “Sample of B-Pellet – Kale” to use as the enriched chloroplast samples in this experiment, since they had the most chloroplasts of the samples. As a result of having the most chloroplasts, these samples engage in more photosynthesis. In other words, the rate of photosynthesis is proportional to the number of chloroplasts. The more chloroplasts present in the sample, the more chloroplasts are available to capture and convert light into energy. 

In the previous experiment in which we explored the effect of environmental factors, specifically light and dark conditions, on the rate of electron transport in photosynthesis using Spinacia oleracea as the model plant, our results showed that the rate of electron transport is higher in light conditions than in dark conditions, because light is needed for the electron transfer to take place during photosynthesis. As photosynthesis proceeds in light conditions, in comparison to dark conditions, more DCPIP is reduced, which means there would be a greater decrease in color and subsequent decline in absorbance values. On the other hand, in dark conditions, there is not a high rate of electron transfer because no light is present to excite the electrons. Our results in this experiment support these findings from our previous experiment, as they show a greater average percent change in absorbance values for light conditions in comparison to dark conditions at a time of thirty minutes for both Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica. 

However, our results for the Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica absorbance values do not support the main component of our hypothesis that Brassica oleracea var. sabellica would have a higher rate of electron transport than Spinacia oleracea. The graph trends show that in general, Brassica oleracea var. sabellica has higher absorbance values at thirty minutes in comparison to Spinacia oleracea, which does not align with our hypothesis because we learned that as photosynthesis proceeds, absorbance values decrease, since 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol is reduced, changing color from blue to colorless. Thus, in accordance with our hypothesis, Brassica oleracea var. sabellica would have had lower absorbance values, indicating a greater rate of electron transport over time. According to our two-sample t-test, our results are insignificant because the p-value of 0.307 is greater than 0.05. Thus, we concluded that the type of plant, particularly its leaf thickness, does not play a large role in reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. Not only did our experiment analyze the effects of varying compositions of different green plants on the rate of electron transfer in photosynthesis, but other studies as well. The results of one study examining how infection affects leaf pigments and the subsequent effect on photosynthetic pigments in Phaseolus vulgaris plants revealed that the decrease in pigment of the leaves, as a consequence of infection, resulted in lower photosynthesis rates [Andrade: 2010]. Therefore, another experiment to conduct in the future would be to text the effect of the shade of green pigment in various plants on the reduction reactions required for photosynthesis.

In reflecting on our experiment, there is room for improvement. An alternative explanation is that the spectrophotometer malfunctioned and would not properly read the absorbance values. As a result, we had to use a different one, which means some readings were conducted using one spectrophotometer and some readings were taken with another. Moreover, in reflecting on our hypothesis and the results of our experiment, we believe a stronger one would have included the specificity of the size of the leaf, to ensure there were a similar amount of chloroplasts present. Looking towards the future, the next logical steps for this study would be to modify the procedure and repeat this experiment. A different procedure step we would change if we repeated the study again would be to use a different green plant as the experimental condition to compare to Spinacia oleracea, the control condition, to ensure that the chloroplasts of the plant are not too large to be read in the light tube. Rather than immediately resorting to using a mortar and pestle to grind the leaves, we would also add a procedure step to chop up the leaves (using a method such as a Cuisinart) to ensure the liquid mixture has enough chloroplasts in it when strained through the cheesecloth. After chopping up the leaves into fine pieces, then we would add the pieces to the mortar and pestle to grind the leaves with the grinding buffer. In addition, we would weigh the Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea leaves to confirm we have the same amount of each, instead of selecting four leaves of each green at random, since the Brassica oleracea var. sabellica leaves were much larger in size. 

Overall, our study revealed that while environmental factors, specifically light and dark conditions, affect the rate of electron transport, no accurate conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of the variability of a plant, particularly the thickness of the leaves, on the reduction reactions in photosynthesis. Our conclusions cause us to question whether the examination of other factors, such as the shade of green of a plant, the number of veins present in a plant, and the environment in which the plant is grown in, would have an effect on the rate of electron transport in photosynthesis.
