Title: Effect of Sodium Channel Blocking on Sciatic Nerve Response in the Frog Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
The objective of the experiment was to test muscle contraction when the contraction cycle is exposed to a channel blocker. We hypothesized that if a frog gastrocnemius muscle was exposed to lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, that its sciatic response would be reduced. This hypothesis was tested by using sleeve electrodes to measure sciatic response. An electrical stimulus was provided to simulate an action potential. The frog leg muscles first underwent the experiment without the presence of lidocaine, and then underwent the experiment exposed to lidocaine. The mean sciatic responses of the control group were all greater than the mean sciatic responses of the experimental group. When a 2.0 V stimulus was used, the mean sciatic response was .866 for the control group, and .388 for the experimental group. This stimulus voltage showed the strongest difference between the two groups. The p-value of 0.0005 confirmed that the data was statistically significant. The lidocaine blocked the sodium channels in the muscle cells which in turn disrupted the influx of calcium ions, which reduced muscle contraction. The hypothesis was supported. This proves to make a promising step towards using lidocaine more surely in the medical field when treating patients.

Introduction:
Skeletal Muscles in vertebrates consist of thousands of skeletal muscle cells known as myofibers. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, and the axons of these motor neurons extend into individual myofibers known as neuromuscular junctions (Johnson AD. Neuromuscular Control. Biological Principles Laboratory Manual. Dept. Biology, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC. Vers. 18.2 (updated August 2,2018), pp.17)  At the neuromuscular junctions, nerve impulses arrive causing the release of Acetyl choline (Ach). Ach binds to its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, causing the opening of sodium channels. Sodium rushes into the cell and depolarizes it, which leads to the formation of an action potential. The action potential spreads through the length of the fiber, stimulating the release of Calcium ions from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum, the Endoplasmic Reticulum of the muscle (Johnson AD. Neuromuscular Control. Biological Principles Laboratory Manual. Dept. Biology, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC. Vers. 18.2 (updated August 2,2018), pp.17). Once the calcium ions are released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum, the contractile mechanism of the muscle is activated, and the muscle shortens (Bio Laboratory Manual). A myogram is used to record the three distinct phases of muscle contraction: the latent period, the contraction phase and the relaxation phase. The latent period lasts for less than 10 seconds and is the period between the time of stimulation and start of contraction. When the muscle has reached maximum contraction during the contraction phase, the muscle returns to a relaxed state during the relaxation phase (Johnson AD. Neuromuscular Control. Biological Principles Laboratory Manual. Dept. Biology, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC. Vers. 18.2 (updated August 2,2018), pp.17).    Research has allotted up over the decades claiming that muscle contraction process can be inhibited. For example, an article from The Journal of Physiology wrote that when a rabbit psoas muscle was under moderate fatigue, it experienced isometric muscle tension when there were increased levels of phosphate and proteins (Cooke, 1998). Another potential inhibitor of the muscle is the drug Lidocaine. Lidocaine is presently used as an anesthetic to temporarily numb an applied area. We hypothesized that treating a frog leg’s gastrocnemius muscle with lidocaine will reduce its sciatic muscle response. Since lidocaine functions to block sodium channels, we believe that it will block the sodium channels in the frog leg, thus preventing depolarization of muscle cells which in turn will produce less of a response. 


Materials and Methods:
To test the relationship between sciatic muscle response and the sodium channel blocker lidocaine, we dissected the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg. We used sleeve electrodes of a BNC connector as well as a BNC adapter and the Lab Scribe application to provide 3 different stimuli similar to that of an action potential and to measure the response. We used stimuli of 0.3 Volts, 0.5 Volts and 2.0 volts. Using 3 different frog legs, the control group of the experiment was the three frog legs not exposed to lidocaine and the experimental group was the 3 frog legs after being injected with lidocaine. The independent variable was the stimulus voltage while the dependent variable was the sciatic response voltage.  A syringe was used to inject the lidocaine directly into the muscle. After the injection of lidocaine, there was about a 2 minute wait period before continuing the experiment. The confounding variable of fluidity in the muscle was eliminated by keeping the tissue of the muscle moist with frog ringer. We recorded the voltage of the sciatic responses for each frog leg with and without lidocaine, and calculated the mean sciatic response for both groups at the three voltages we tested.  To test the significance of the data, a paired t-test was conducted.


Results:
Overall, the all the control group sciatic response voltages are greater than the experimental group sciatic responses, and that can be shown by the table in Figure 1 displaying the mean sciatic response of each experiment group at different stimuli. For example, the mean sciatic response for the control group at 0.5 V was 0.75 V, while the sciatic response of the group exposed to lidocaine was about 0.25 V.  Another general trend that we observed was that in some of the groups, the sciatic response would increase with an increase in stimuli strength, but would then decrease after a certain point. The two groups are statistically significant because the paired t-test resulted in a p-value of 0.0005.


Discussion:
Based off of our results, our hypothesis that lidocaine would reduce sciatic response was supported. A p-value of 0.0005 was recorded, proving that the data of the two groups was statistically significant and that these results did not arise from chance. According to Figure 1, all of the control group mean sciatic responses are greater than the mean sciatic responses of the experimental group at each different stimulus, displaying that muscle response was reduced when treated with lidocaine. A p-value of 0.0005 was recorded, proving that the data of the two groups was statistically significant and that these results did not arise from chance. The main event occurring is that Lidocaine is blocking sodium channels in the muscle cells, thus inhibiting the depolarization of cells which is inhibiting the release of calcium ions. In turn, the blocking of these sodium channels is yielding a smaller nerve reaction, which produces less of a sciatic response. This is backed by an article written by Tianhan Kai, stating that Lidocaine directly relaxes smooth muscle airways by inhibiting the Ach-induced release of stored calcium ions, which inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions (Kai, 1993). To further research this, I would repeat the experiment but with a wider range of stimuli voltages. I would keep the same hypothesis, but use 4 voltages of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. The range used in this experiment wasn’t very spread out, so a repeat of the experiment with a better spread of stimuli voltages would provide even clearer results as a confirmation of this experiment.
