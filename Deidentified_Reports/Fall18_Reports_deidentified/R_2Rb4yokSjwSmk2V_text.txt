Title: The Effect of Sunlight Intensity on Field Pea Biomass

Abstract:
It is well known that plants need sunlight to grow, but to what degree does the amount of sunlight plants get affect their biomass? In this experiment, we observed the biomass accumulation of pea plants (Pisum sativum) in direct sunlight and under a shade to reduce sunlight exposure. 

Introduction:
It is well known that plants need sunlight to grow. This information is fundamental to photoautotrophs; plants need sunlight to grow, develop, and carry out life processes. Light is an important limiting factor when it come to plant development, growth, and biomass accumulation [Yasin et al.: 2016]. In photosynthesis, plants use captured light energy to convert water, minerals, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and organic compound filled with energy [Lambers and Bassham: 2018]. At medium to low light intensities, the rate of photosynthesis increases as light intensity increases [Lambers and Bassham: 2018]. Experiments have established that there is a trade-off between quick growth in high light intensity and survivorship in low light intensity [Kitajima: 1994]. When there is competition for light (for instance, in a canopy), plants may be exposed to different intensities of light [Yasin et al.: 2016]. Reductions in light intensity impacts the balance of photoreceptor phytochrome [Yasin et al.: 2016]. The phytochrome system regulates important plant responses to stimuli, which includes flowering, chloroplast development, leaf aging and separation [Yasin et al.: 2016]. Plant use hormones as a response to stimuli to affect plant behavior. One of these types of hormones are auxins, which are formed in young growing plant organs [Berry et al.: 2018]. Auxins are transported away from shoot tips and prompt cells to elongate and occasionally divide [Berry et al: 2018]. Auxin distributions are responsible for phototropic responses like plant growth toward sunlight [Berry et al.: 2018]. Therefore, sunlight is greatly important to plant growth because of its role in photosynthesis and auxin hormones. Field peas, or Pisum sativum, are herbaceous annual legumes [Pisum sativum Garden Pea: 2018]. Like all legumes, field peas are able to host nitrogen-fixing bacteria and maintain a symbiotic relationship [Smith-Martin et al.: 2017]. Field peas should exhibit a response to sunlight that is similar to angiosperms. Field peas exposed to sunlight will have a different biomass than those under a shade. 

Materials and Methods:
Seeds were soaked for thirty minutes before they were planted. While the seeds were soaking, twelve four inch by four inch pots were labeled with the corresponding lab group, lab period, and treatment. Six of the pots were treated with direct sunlight in a greenhouse, and the other six were placed under a shade to reduce the intensity of the sunlight. The twelve pots were filled to the top with vermiculite. The vermiculite in all pots were pre-watered and miracle grow was added to all twelve pots. After the seeds had soaked for thirty minutes, five seeds were planted in each pot. The five seeds made the same pattern as five dots on a dice would. Using a finger, an indention was made in the vermiculite about two or three times deeper than the seed’s size. This gave the seeds enough space to grow their roots and shoots. The planted seeds were gently covered with vermiculite. The pots with their seeds were kept in a greenhouse and watered daily for ten days. When the plants were watered, a halfway to one-quarter-way filled water can was held over each pot for three seconds each. After the ten days had passed, three random pea plants were carefully removed from each replicate pot to keep the roots intact. There were eighteen total plants from both treatment groups measured. The vermiculite was rinsed off the roots and patted dry by sitting on a paper towel. Each plant’s mass was measured and recorded. The mean mass and standard deviation of each treatment group were calculated. A two tailed two-sample t-test was used to analyze these data at the ɑ=0.05 significance level. 


Results:
The plants in direct sunlight had a mean biomass of 1.57 g and a standard deviation of 0.32 (Fig. 1). The plants under the shade had a mean biomass of 1.47 g and a standard deviation of 0.33 (Fig. 2). We used a two tailed two-sample t-test to analyze these data. The difference between the mean pea plant mass in the shade and the mean pea plant mass in the sunlight was not statistically significant (t-stat = 0.9659, df = 34, P = 0.3409). The two tailed two sample t-test gave a p-value of 0.3409, meaning that results like these or more extreme would occur 34.09% of the time if these results were due to chance alone. Because the p-value is much more than the ɑ=0.05 significance level, these results are not statistically significant and do not support the hypothesis. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the plants exposed to a higher light intensity would have a different mean biomass than the plants exposed to a lower light intensity, was not supported by these results. While there was a slight difference in the means, that difference was not statistically significant. These results could be due to the possibility that the difference in light intensity was not great enough to show significant results. Because the rate of photosynthesis increases as light intensity increases at low to medium light intensity, we thought that the mean biomass of the two treatment groups would differ [Lambers and Bassham: 2018]. Perhaps using multiple shades would reduce the light intensity enough to reduce auxin production to an extent that would restrict growth and biomass accumulation. Additionally, another reason why these data did not produce statistically significant results could be because this experiment was conducted over a short period of time: only ten days. The plants did not use up their stored nutrients from their seeds (the seed was still visible on all the pea plants), so they did not have enough time to begin relying on photosynthesis to generate chemical energy. Given these possibilities, running a similar experiment for a longer period with more treatment groups could produce more convincing results.
