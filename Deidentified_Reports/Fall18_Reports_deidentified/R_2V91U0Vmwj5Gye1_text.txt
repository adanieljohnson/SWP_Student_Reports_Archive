Title: The Effect of Martin’s IGR on the Growth of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta’s life cycle is extremely dependent on hormones to regulate molting and reaching the commitment pulse. In this experiment, we tested the hypothesis that if Manduca Sexta Caterpillars were exposed to Martin’s IGR, then they would weigh less than Manduca Sexta caterpillars not exposed to it. The Martin’s IGR was injected into the food of one group, while the other received water. This resulted in similar results in terms of weight as the overall growth rate of the experimental group was 0.691 grams, slightly larger than the control group’s 0.659 grams. However, the group of caterpillars not exposed to the IGR were all in the process of pupating while the other group was not. It seemed that the juvenile hormone was still present in the group that was exposed to the IGR, which was not letting them pupate and instead was forcing them to grow into large larvae.


Introduction:
The insect we will be running the experiment on is known as the Manduca Sexta. The Manduca Sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, undergoes a holometabolous life cycle. The Manduca Sexta grows fast and can be easily accessed to take measurements, which make them perfect for the experiment. The passage from one life stage to another requires molting. The process of molting is when an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer. The process of molting is largely regulated by the juvenile hormone, which regulates the type of molt as well as multiple functions in adult insects. The juvenile hormone is crucial to the Manduca Sexta hitting the commitment pulse, which is produced when the signals indicate that the caterpillar is big enough and has stored enough nutrients to pupate, in which case a series of sequential changes will happen at the start of metamorphosis. However, it is possible that this development can be inhibited by insect growth regulators (IGRs) (Comparative Physiology Bio 11 Laboratory Manual, Wake Biology). (These “IGRs” can affect physical development as well as development of their offspring. According to an article written by H. Frederik Nijhout and Carrol Williams, a failure to cease secreting JH results in the development of mature larvae, which would yield a lower weight for the caterpillars affected with an IGR. Based off this information, we hypothesized that if the Manduca Sexta caterpillars are exposed to Martin’s IGR, then they will weigh less than the caterpillars that are not exposed to it. We believe that this is the case because if the caterpillars are exposed to the IGR, we are predicting that they will not pupate because they will not be able to hit their commitment pulse, thus yielding a lower weight to that of the group of caterpillars that is not exposed to the IGR.


Materials and Methods:
In the experiment, there were 4 control group caterpillars, and four experimental group caterpillars. The experimental caterpillars were fed daily (food changed every 3 days) and in their food, would be 5 drops of Martin’s IGR. The control group was fed the same way, but with 5 drops of water in their food rather than Martin’s IGR. To measure their growth, we weighed them almost every day for two weeks (Ten out of Fourteen Days) in grams. We also took photos from time to time. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator when they weren’t being analyzed so that they were kept at a constant healthy temperature. Within the incubator, they were kept in two separate plastic containers (one for each group) with holes poked on the top to allow for air flow, and each caterpillar had their own section within the container. Once we gathered our results, we used a two-sample t test to analyze the data.


Results:
When first taking down the data, it originally seemed that the Control Group caterpillars were going to weigh more than the Experimental Group caterpillars. However, according to Figures 2 and 3, it seems that caterpillars 2 and 3 in the experimental group are growing at a pace similar to that of the control group. Meanwhile, two of the control group caterpillars did not grow to be as large as the other two. However, one major trend was that all of the caterpillars in the control group were losing weight at the time that they were supposed to pupate, while the experimental group caterpillars barely lost any weight. Two of the Control Group caterpillars had pupated and the other two seemed to be preparing to, while none of the experimental group caterpillars had pupated. According to figure 1, there is no significant statistical difference between the two sets of data because the p value is greater than 0.05.



Discussion:
Based off the data gathered from the experiment, the previous hypothesis was not supported. To begin with, based off the P value of 0.476191, we can confirm that there is no significant statistical difference amongst the data.  The overall mean weights of the control group caterpillars and experimental group caterpillars were very similar, and the control group mean was larger than the experimental group mean. However, there is an explanation for this. Although both groups were similar in weight, only the control group caterpillars were pupating to become adults. This could mean that the Martin’s IGR isn’t allowing the caterpillars to pupate, which means they will not drop in weight as much as the control group caterpillars. The Martin’s IGR is hindering the production of the commitment pulse. The commitment pulse is produced when the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate. Martin’s IGR could be maintaining the production of the Juvenile Hormone, and as long as the Juvenile Hormone is still being produced, the caterpillars are unable to pupate. This result should have yielded a smaller weight for those infected with the IGR, but perhaps the dosage of Martin’s IGR we gave just wasn’t enough to provide a significant difference.  According to an article written by H. Frederik Nijhout and Carrol Williams, a failure to cease secreting JH results in the development of mature larvae, which seems to back the results of this experiment (Nijhout, 1974). Aside from this, another article written by Michael Kanost, Haobo Jiang, and Xiao-Qiang Yu confirms that when an invading pathogen invades, it has diverse responses, which could explain these changes (Kanost, 2004). In order to confirm that this is the case, this experiment should be repeated but with an increased number of replicates. The hypothesis should also be edited to focus on whether or not the experimental caterpillars will pupate or not. This expanded study should also up the dosage of Martin’s IGR from 5 drops to around 7-8 to see if there is a significant change. From this expanded study, I would predict that the increase in replicates would show more caterpillars affected by the IGR not being able to pupate, and that they would weigh less than the caterpillars not exposed to Martin’s IGR.
