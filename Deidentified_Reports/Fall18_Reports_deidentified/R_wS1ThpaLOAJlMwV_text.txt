Title: The effect of plant density on the root to shoot ratio of a field pea plant

Abstract:
This study investigates the role of plant population density on plant’s resource allocation by testing the effect of increasing plant population density on the root to shoot ratios of field pea plants, Pisum Sativums.  We hypothesize that if the population density is increased in a pot containing pea plants then the root to shoot ratio will also increase. To test this hypothesis, ten pea plants were separated into one pot and twenty pea plants were separated into another pot. These plants grew for two weeks, were harvest, and the mean root to shoot ratios for each group were recorded. It was concluded that the Pisum Sativums growing in a more highly populated environment had a higher mean root to shoot ratio than the Pisum Sativums growing in a lower population density. This reveals that more resources are allocated towards the roots than the shoots of a plant when the organism is facing a lack of resources. Overall, the hypothesis was supported because the null hypothesis could not be supported and the data was statistically significent (p=0.025).  


Introduction:
Many plant interactions revolve around obtaining essential resources to sustain life and support plant growth.  These resources include materials such as carbon dioxide, water, nutrients, sugars, proteins, and defensive chemicals. Light levels and soil moisture concentration are also important factors when considering the resources available to plants [Bazzaz: 1997].  Because these resources are limited due to variability and high plant densities, plants must allocate resources effectively.  Allocation has to do with both the transportation of these resources throughout the different parts of the plant and the utilization of these resources [Thornley: 1971]. Resources obtained from the environment are processed in the plant and allocated to various plant parts and mechanisms. Allocation is meant to maximize both plant fertility and lifetime fitness. Therefore, any changes in resource availability from the environment, such as, a higher surrounding plant population density, a lack of nutrients, drought, or consistent cloudy weather, will lead to altered allocation of resources that maximizes plant growth [Bazzaz: 1997].
Resource allocation can be measured by taking the biomass of various parts of the plants. Biomass allocation is a strong indicator of the ability of plants to absorb nutrients, carbon, and water [Poorter: 2011]. Biomass of the root and biomass of the shoot can be taken to calculate the root to shoot ratio which serves as an indicator of how a plant is allocating resources when under resource strain. It is often found that a higher root to shoot ratio is indicative of fewer available resources because roots must grow longer, yielding a higher biomass, to obtain necessary resources from the environment while stems grow shorter, yielding a lower biomass, from the lack of resources available [Poorter: 2011]. 
The experiment described below tests the effect of higher plant density on resource allocation in a field pea plant, Pisum Sativum, by comparing root to shoot ratios. Discovering the effect of plant density on resource allocation and plant growth will provide useful insights into improving agricultural techniques, such as how far apart to plant crops while still maximizing land use. Based on the above research, plant’s roots grow longer in areas of low nutrients in order to maximize the minimal resources that are available when competing for resources in areas of high plant density. Therefore, it is hypothesized that if a Pisum Sativum is planted in soil with a high plant density then it will have a higher root to shoot ratio than a plant growing in a less populated area. 


Materials and Method:
To carry out the experiment, ten Pisum Sativum (low density group) were planted in one, double lined pot and twenty Pisum Sativum (high density group) were planted in another double lined pot of equal size. All thirty plants were placed in a greenhouse under controllled conditions, watered, and five milliliters of Miracle Grow was added to each pot. The plants remained in the greenhouse for two weeks. Each day of the experiment, aside from two days during Hurricane Florence, the plants were watered at 4pm. When the two weeks were completed, ten plants from the low density group and ten plants from the high density group were harvested. The plants from the low density group were massed together, and the plants from the high density group were massed together. Then, their roots were separated from their shoots using scissors. Each shoot was then massed separately and each root was massed separately. A root to shoot ratio was determined from each of the twenty plants harvested. A mean root to shoot ratio was calculated for the plants from the low density group and a mean root to shoot ration was calculated for the plants from the high density group. After sufficient data was collected, the mean root to shoot ratios of the plants in the low density group were compared to the mean root to shoot ratios of the plants in the high density group using a two-sample t_test. 


Results:
Overall, the data shows that the field pea plants growing in a higher population density environment have a greater average root to shoot ration than the plants growing in a lower density population environment. Overall, it was observed that the shoots of plants growing in low density environments were longer and the roots of plants growing in high density environments were longer.  This explains why the root to shoot ratios of the plants in the high density environment were higher than the root to shoot ratios of the plants growing in the low density environment.

After performing a two-sample T-test using the average root to shoot ratios of the plants in the low population density and high population density groups, it was determined that the t-value=2.45 and the one-tailed p=0.025.  Because the p_value is less than 0.05, or 5%, it is concluded that the data is significently different and, therefore, the results are statistically significent. 


Discussion:
In conclusion, the hypothesis was supported because the null hypothesis could not be supported (p=0.025). The mean root to shoot ratio of the plants growing in a high density environment is higher than the mean root to shoot ration of the plants growing in a low density environment. This means that the roots of plants growing in a high density environment must grow longer than the roots of plants growing in a low density environment. Therefore, more resources are being allocated to the roots of a plant when it is under resource strain than are being allocated to the shoots of the plant. This reveals the important job of roots in absorbing both nutrients and water for the entire plant, regulating sink-source interactions, and distributing resources both above and below ground [Schultz: 2013]. If the roots are not absorbing the nutrients necessary to sustain life for the plant, they will continue to grow in order to absorb the little nutrients that are available for the plant. 
According to a study on plant resource allocation, referenced in the introduction of this report, allocation plays an essential role in the study of evolutionary and functional ecology [Bazzaz: 1997]. Resource allocation affects the biomass of various plant parts which will ultimately affect how those plants evolve. This explains the importance of understanding how resource allocation works in plants applies to the rest of biology. In addition to understanding how resource allocation contributes to evolution, this experiment helps provide insight into useful agricultural techniques. Understanding that crops may not grow as tall when in a high plant density environment is important when planning how many crops to plant and where to plant them. 
Moving forward, it is important to assess the limitations of this experiment before repeating it. Using biomass and root to shoot ratio as a means to collect data has some limitations because it groups all above ground bio mass into one category. However, leaves and roots have very different functions [Poorter: 2011].  In addition, measurement of below ground roots may greatly underestimate the actual allocations going to the roots because the distribution of ions and water absorption below ground is often not accounted for [Bazzaz: 1997]. In the future it would be beneficial to assess resource allocation in a more precise and accurate way, other than root to shoot ratios.
