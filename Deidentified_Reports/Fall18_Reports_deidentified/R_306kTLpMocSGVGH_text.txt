Title: The cumulative agnostic behavior of Betta splendins reduces in the presence of shelter

Abstract:
Animals have specific intraspecific behaviors for territory, and the males of many species show specific behaviors when competing with each other for territory and mates. Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish or simply Betta fish, are a popular model organism for studying aggressive and reproductive intraspecific behaviors. There are multiple ways in which a Betta can respond to another’s agnostic behaviors. They could ignore it, match it, flee, show submissive signals, or escalate. In this experiment, the effects of shelter on overall Betta aggression were tested to understand the possible fitness advantage of fleeing and hiding rather than engaging in agnostic displays or fighting. The mean cumulative agnostic behavior of Bettas without shelter was 45.5 +/- 7.868, and the mean cumulative agnostic behavior of Bettas in the presence of shelter was 12 +/- 13.755. There was a significent reduction in cumulative Betta aggression when shelter was present, thus suggesting there is a fitness advantage to not engaging in agnostic displays and fighting.

Introduction:
Animals have specific intraspecific behaviors for territory, and the males of many species show specific behaviors when competing with each other for territory and mates. Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish or simply Betta fish, are a popular model organism for studying aggressive and reproductive intraspecific behaviors [Maclaren: 2018]. Wild Bettas are small fish in the gourami family found in freshwater, slow moving and stagnant, overgrown bodies of water in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Wild Bettas turn vibrant colors during displays of agnostic behaviors, but aquarium Betta fish have been selectively bred to permanently show these bright colors [Forsatkar: 2017]. Broadside and facing movements are two common movements included in Bettas’ agnostic intraspecific behaviors [Johnson: 2018]. Broadside movement and displays involve a fish turning its side to its opponent, and this type of display includes pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing as typical movements [Johnson: 2018]. Pelvic fin flickering, the least aggressive of the broadside movements, occurs when a Betta moves its pelvic fin in vertical motions opposite its opponent [Johnson: 2018]. Tail beating involves sudden movements of a Betta’s caudal fin in the opponent’s direction [Johnson: 2018]. Tail flashing, the most aggressive of the broadside movements, involves a Betta closing and opening its caudal fin [Johnson: 2018]. There are also three main types of facing movements. The least aggressive of the three involves a Betta facing an opponent with erect pectoral fins [Johnson: 2018]. Usually at the same time, the Betta will spread out its gill covers, or opercula [Johnson: 2018]. The most aggressive facing movement is called a red mane, in which a male Betta will protrude its branchiostegal membranes from underneath the opercula [Johnson: 2018]. There are multiple ways in which a Betta can respond to another’s agnostic behaviors. They could ignore it, match it, flee, show submissive signals, or escalate [Johnson: 2018]. Similarly, the Betta that made the original display has the same options for responding to the new behavior [Johnson: 2018].  Animals have specific intraspecific behaviors for territory, and the males of many species show specific behaviors when competing with each other for territory and mates. Ethology is the study of animal behavior and combines observation, natural history, laboratory studies, and theories and knowledge from evolutionary biology, genetics, and ecology. Ethologists pursue to comprehend the interactions between behaviors, physiology, evolution, and selection rather than isolating behavior [Johnson: 2018]. Ethologists are particularly interested in learning more about the costs and benefits of submission, escalation, and other behaviors and their relationship to reproductive fitness [Johnson: 2018]. Aggressive interactions in animals rarely escalate to fighting; these series of displays animals use in confrontation instead escalate until one of the opponents forfeits. Opponents who are very evenly matched will resort to fighting, but this is a rare occurrence. Conflict costs energy; engaging is aggressive encounters causes serious increases in metabolism and oxygen requirements and introduces more risk for physical injury or death [Forsatkar: 2017]. To observe the relationship between agnostic behavior and shelter, I introduced two male Betta fish and observed the frequency and types of agnostic behaviors they displayed in the presence and absence of shelter. I hypothesize that the presence of shelter allowed threatened Betta fish to flee and reduced the display of agnostic behaviors. 

Materials and Method:
Four male Betta splendins and a tank divided into three compartments with removable glass and white plastic dividers were obtained. Three of the Bettas were placed into the tank, each in its own compartment, and the fourth was kept in a small tank. The four Bettas were divided into six pairs so that each Betta interacted with the other three. The divider between a pair was removed, and the two Bettas’ behaviors were observed and recorded. After five minutes of interaction, the Bettas were isolated to their own compartment and the glass and white plastic dividers were returned. If needed, a small aquarium net was used to separate and move the Bettas. The pair was given five minutes to rest. Then, an aquarium shelter in the shape of a dinosaur skull was placed in the compartments with one of the Bettas in the pair. The dividers between the same pair were removed, and their interactions were observed and recorded for five minutes. After the five minutes, the fish were separated, the dividers were returned, and the shelter was removed from the tank. This process was repeated for all six pairs of Bettas, and Bettas were placed in adjacent compartments of the divided tank using an aquarium net when necessary.  To quantify and analyze these data, the types of agnostic behaviors were scored as follows: 1, Pelvic fin flickering and pectoral fins erect; 2, tail beating and gill flaring; 3, tail flashing and red mane. The total number of behaviors each Betta presented were recorded, and the total quantified behaviors were summed to make the cumulative agnostic behavior score. The mean cumulative agnostic behavior was calculated in the presence and absence of shelter. A one-tailed paired t_test was used to analyze these data at the α = 0.05 significance level to find if the mean cumulative agnostic behavior of Betta fish was statistically lower when a shelter was present. 

Results:
The Betta fish had a mean cumulative agnostic behavior of 45.5 +/- 7.868 when there was no shelter present and a mean cumulative agnostic behavior of 12 +/- 13.755 where the shelter was present (Fig. 1). The difference between the means was statistically significent (t_stat = 8.486, d.f. = 5, P = 0.000187). 

Discussion:
These data support my hypothesis and show that there is a significent reduction in male Betta fish agnostic behaviors in the presence of shelter. The presence of shelter allowed the Bettas to flee in response to another Betta’s agnostic display, or the shelter presented the Bettas from seeing each other, which resulted in no agnostic displays. When the Bettas were in the tank without a shelter, they had nowhere to hide and had to engage in displaying agnostic behaviors. Some of the Bettas tried to flee when there was no shelter, but they were unable because they were in an enclosed space. When there was no shelter present, there was a high amount of agnostic behaviors (mean 45.5 +/- 7.868). When the shelter was introduced, the amount of agnostic behaviors was much lower (mean 12 +/- 12.755). A possible reason why cumulative aggression decreased was that the Bettas could respond to an opponent’s agnostic displays by fleeing and hiding, which was not possible when a shelter was absent [Johnson: 2018]. Because fighting and presenting agnostic displays is costly in energy and risks injury or death, fleeing and hiding would be a beneficial alternative if a male Betta could not beat its opponent [Forsatkar: 2017]. Given this, there may be some fitness advantage to fleeing and hiding when an opponent male Betta fish makes an agnostic display rather than engaging in agnostic displays or fighting.
