Title: Effects of Synthetic Juvenile Hormone Methoprene on Manduca sexta Caterpillar Growth in Terms of Weight

Abstract:
 Growth regulators are known to interfere with the overall development process of insects making them a better alternative to pesticides. They inhibit the insect's ability to reproduce which eventually eradicates the field of any traces of the pest. Growth regulators are known to affect the amount of juvenile hormone, a hormone essential to the process of molting, pupation, and maturation in insects, thus, with the normal release of juvenile hormone disrupted by the growth regulators, the insect will never be able to reach adulthood. In this experiment, we examined the effects of the growth regulator Martin’s IGR (methoprene) on the overall growth process, in terms of weight, on Manduca sexta caterpillars. By feeding Manduca sexta caterpillars a diet with an added six drops of methoprene, the individuals overall weight should begin to decrease as its body can no longer carry out basic functions and begins to shut down. In the end, we found through a one tailed p-value that our results were significant, but the actual data did not support this finding. Even though the null hypothesis was rejected, caterpillars fed a control diet (only ten grams of food) weighed less than those fed food with the methoprene by the end of the nine day experiment.   

Introduction:
Manduca sexta caterpillars can often be seen as pests for companies in the tobacco business. They eat, and oftentimes destroy, crop yields. In order to combat this issue, farmers are turning to a new form of pest control that hinders normal insect growth, rather than killing the pest. By interrupting the insect's developmental processes, the hope is that they will never fully mature, therefore inhibiting their ability to reproduce, and eventually the species will die ogg in the farmer’s fields.
For this particular experiment, we investigated the effects of such “insect growth regulators” that specifically targeted and inhibited juvenile hormones in the eight Manduca sexta caterpillars observed. 
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is one of the main hormones involved in the endocrine system of insects. As insects grow and pass through the stages of molting, pupation, and finally becoming an adult, Juvenile Hormone is one of three main hormones that control these processes and ensure the insects ultimate survival. More specifically, JH regulates the type of molt that occurs at each of the Maduca sexta’s five developmental instars. At the fourth instar JH levels in Manduca sexta begin to drop, and by the fifth instar these levels have plummeted, thus indicating that the caterpillar has enough nutrients and is mature enough to begin pupation. 
As discovered in a previous study investigating the effects of the methoprene on Manduca sexta caterpillars, and subsequently other insects, the methoprene inhibited the overall emergence of the insect. The methoprene suppresses the release of juvenile hormone and overall interrupted the process of pupation and maturation [Beckage: 1982]. Thus, we can conclude that by feeding Manduca sexta caterpillars food with six drops of the insect growth regulator methoprene, the weight of the caterpillar should decrease as it begins to interfere with each insects levels of JH, disrupting normal growth patterns.  


Materials and Methods:
In order to begin our experiment, eight Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing one to five grams were selected, and divided into two groups of four. Each caterpillar was then placed in its own container and given ten grams of food. Each caterpillar was then selected to receive one of two diets. The first diet, or the control diet, was fed to the first four caterpillars and costied of ten grams of caterpillar food. The second diet was fed to the other four caterpillars and was ten grams of caterpillar food with six drops of Martin’s IGR (methoprene). Throughout the duration of the experiment, each caterpillar was kept in the same incubator at twenty-five degrees celsius for nine days. After nine days, we recorded the final weight of each caterpillar with descriptions of how each caterpillar seemed to be holding up. In terms of statistical testing used, we found the degrees of freedom (7), t-value (3.94), and one tailed p-value (&lt; .01) for the two treatment groups. The two treatment groups compared were the control group, or the group fed ten grams of only caterpillar food, and the experimental group, or the group fed ten grams of caterpillar food with six drops of methoprene incorporated. 


Results:
	Through the conduction of our experiment, we were able to conclude that the experimental group of Manduca sexta caterpillars, or the group that was fed ten grams of food with sex added drops of methoprene, weighed more after the nine days than the control group did. There was also the occurrence of death within the control group at the end of the nine days causing some caterpillars to have the same weight (or similar weight) for a few of the days. It was also concluded that Manduca sexta caterpillars in the experimental group ate more overall than those in the control group. 



Discussion:
Since the one tailed p-value calculated was &lt; .01, we can reject the null hypothesis and state that our results were significant. However, this does not completely represent our data correctly. We originally hypothesised that Manduca sexta fed the diet of ten grams of caterpillar food with sex drops of added methoprene, would experience an overall decrease in weight, as the the growth regulator began to interfere with the caterpillars normal growth patterns. The methoprene should have caused the internal systems of each caterpillar to begin to shut down as the organism should eventually die. After experimentation however, we found that individuals fed the diet with methoprene experienced an increase in weight and overall seemed healthier throughout the duration of the experiment than those selected for the control group. Caterpillars in the control group slowly began to die as the experiment progressed which does not correlate with our overall data collection and calculations. This discrepancy in our data could be attributed to the amount of methoprene actually fed to each caterpillar. The methoprene solution placed in the food of each caterpillar was so diluted that the effects cannot truly be observed. Also, due to environmental difficulties (hurricane Florence) we were unable to collect data for several days, and were forced to discontinue the experiment after only nine days. This too could have caused the discrepancy in our data as we could not see the full effects of the methoprene over the anticipated fourteen day experiment. 
	Our results are still relatively puzzling even when compared to outside sources and previously conducted experiments. As found by Beckage and Riddiford in their 1982 experiment, individuals manipulated by methoprene and or juvenile hormone had delays in normal growth processes. The host parasite they were examining inside if Manduca sexta caterpillars had a delay in “emergence” from the host body, suggesting that methoprene slowed their internal developmental processes [Beckage: 1982]. Based upon these findings, we could have expected to see similar results, in that the methoprene should have slowed the internal growth processes in the Manduca sexta caterpillars. We should have seen an overall decrease in weight of those fed a diet with methoprene instead of the increase that was collected and observed.

Larger bar is experimental group, or group fed a diet of ten grams of caterpillar food with six drops of methoprene added. Four caterpillars were in each group and exposed to food conditions for nine days at the same temperature of twenty-five degrees celsius. Weight of each caterpillar was measured in grams daily, and results were averaged to create figure shown above. Error bars represent mean weight of caterpillars from each dietary treatment group. Error bars are +/- 2.99 for experimental group, and +/- 1.96 for control group.
