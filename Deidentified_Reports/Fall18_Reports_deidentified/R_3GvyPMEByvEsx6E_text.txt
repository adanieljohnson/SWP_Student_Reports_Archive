Title: No Effect of Carbonated Water on Photosynthetic Rates of spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
	In this study, the effect of excess carbon dioxide in the form of carbonated water was tested on the photosynthetic rates of isolated spinacia oleracea chloroplasts. Carbon dioxide is a major reactant in the reaction of photosynthesis, serving as a source of carbon for glucose formation. We believe that the increased amount of carbon dioxide will increase the rate of photosynthesis per Le Chatelier’s Principle. The Hill reaction was used to measure the rate of change of photosynthesis at four time points, over the course of thirty minutes. Three test groups of water, a 50:50 mixture of water and carbonated water, and 100 percent carbonated water were used. None of the test groups were found to have a significent difference in photosynthetic rates. The acid produced in carbonated water was thought to affect the color and absorbance values of the samples, confounding any results.

Introduction:
Energy in plants is derived using photosynthesis, where water and carbon dioxide are converted into glucose, water and oxygen molecules. During photosynthesis, small, green molecules called chloroplast absorb energy from the sun. This energy is used to excite electrons, which trigger a reaction that divides water molecules into electrons and protons. The electrons are stored in NADPH, while the protons create a gradient across a membrane. This gradient helps create ATP, the main energy storage molecule of the cell. ATP and the reduced NADPH come together to create the six-carbon glucose molecule from one carbon carbon dioxide molecules. 
	According to Le Chatelier’s principle, the amount of glucose made, and the rate of photosynthesis can be changed by altering the amount of reactants available. In this experiment, we will be changing the amount of carbon dioxide available by giving spinacia oleracea chloroplasts access to distilled water, carbonated water, or a 50:50 mix of each. 
	In a study on different species of European forest trees, it was found that in all experiments, higher levels of carbon dioxide concentration led to a higher rate of photosynthesis. However, in the same experiment it was found that when photosynthesis was measured at the same time as carbon dioxide concentration, photosynthetic rates dropped by ten to twenty percent. It was believed that this effect was due to the effects of carbon dioxide concentration in the leaves on nitrogen concentration in the same area [Medlyn: 2002]. 
In an experiment done at the University of Colorado at Boulder, plants being watered with carbonated water grew more than twice as large as plants that received tap water. Part of this growth was attributed to nutrients such as potassium, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and sodium are already being dissolved in the carbonated water, so they were easier to absorb [Danzell: 2002].
For these reasons, we decided that we wanted to study the effect of carbonated water on the isolated chloroplasts of spinach leaves, measuring the rate of photosynthesis. We decided to use the Hill reaction to help measure the rates of photosynthesis. The Hill reaction interacts with the excited electrons and their carriers that help form glucose. In the reaction, DCIP, an electron acceptor carrier that acts much the same as NADPH. DCIP in its oxidized form is dark blue but turns clear in its reduced form due to a change in conformation. This change in color can be measured by spectrophotometry. This allows us to use absorbance values to calculate the rates of photosynthesis. Spinacia oleracea was chosen as it has historically been shown that its isolated chloroplasts behave the same as chloroplasts that are still within the cell [Park: 1966].
	We hypothesize that as the amount of carbon dioxide available increases with addition of carbonated water, the rate of photosynthesis will increase. 


Materials and Method:
10Ml of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in 8.0 pH Tricine buffer) were added to a mortar with deveined spinach leaves and the mixture was ground into a paste. Another 10Ml of grinding buffer were added and mixed thoroughly. This mixture was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the cold medium sized beaker. The strained liquid was transferred into a cold 50Ml centrifuge tube. The tube was spun with a counterbalance at 200G for three minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After spinning, only the supernatant was transferred into a separate 50Ml tube. This sample was centrifuged at 1000G for ten minutes at four degrees Celsius. The supernatant was poured from this sample into a beaker. The tube containing the pellet was placed on ice, and 20Ml of grinding buffer was added. The pellet was resuspended with gentle stirring. 
	For the experiment stage, ten large test tubes were labeled as follows: one “blank”, three “water”, three “50:50”, and three “carbonated water”. The blank tube contained 8Ml of distilled water and 2Ml of reaction buffer.  Each water tube contained 6Ml of water and 2Ml of reaction buffer. The 50:50 tubes contained 3Ml each of distilled water and carbonated water, with 2Ml of reaction buffer. The carbonated water tubes contained only 6Ml of carbonated water and 2Ml of reaction buffer. 
When all tubes were prepared, the “water”, “50:50”, and “carbonated water” tubes were filled each with 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP. 100 microliters of enriched chloroplasts from the resuspended pellet were added to all tubes, including the blank immediately before measuring absorbance. The spectrophotometer was set to 600nm and blanked using the blank sample. The absorbance of each sample was read and recorded. All samples were placed on a sunny windowsill. The spectrophotometer was blanked again and absorbances were measured after 10 minutes. This was repeated twice more for a total incubation time of 30 minutes. 
The percent change of the absorbance for each sample for 0-10 minutes, 0-20 minutes and 0-30 minutes was calculated. The average absorbance and percent change were calculated for each sample at each time point.  
Three one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests were run to determine if there was significent difference between the percent change in absorbance for each sample for each time period; 0-10, 0-20 and 0-30. Alpha value was 0.05 [Johnson: 2016].


Results:
As seen in Figure 1, the absorbance values for the water samples were greater than both the 50:50 samples and the carbonated samples. The absorbances for each sample set followed the same pattern of a decrease from time zero to time 10, and increase from time 10 to time 20, and another decrease from time 20 to time 30. 

	Three ANOVA tests were run for the percent change for each of the three samples in each testing group. The first ANOVA, for the percent change between 0-10 minutes yielded p= 0.503, with a Tukey-Kramer test stating there was no significent difference between any of the groups. The second ANOVA, for the percent change between 0-20 minutes yielded p= 0.313, with a Tukey-Kramer test stating there was no significent difference between any groups. The last ANOVA for the percent change between 0 and 30 minutes yielded p= 0.974, with a Tukey-Kramer result of no significent difference between any groups. 


Discussion:
According to our ANOVA tests, none of our groups were significently different from each other in percent change at any time. This data does not support our hypothesis, which was that the percent change would increase more quickly over time in groups with carbonated water present. 
	We believe that our results were confounded by the fact that carbonated water caused the colored samples to become a lilac purple, instead of a blue color. This change in color affected the absorbance of the samples, as they absorbed different wavelengths of light from the beginning. We believe this occurred because DCPIP turns pink in acidic environments. Carbonated water is a mixture of CO2 and H20, which creates H2CO3, or carbonic acid. Due to this color change, we are unable to differentiate between differences in color, and differences in photosynthetic rates. 
	Previous studies have demonstrated that the Hill reaction can be enhanced using carbon dioxide [Punnet: 1963]. It was demonstrated that Hill reactions are dependent upon the presence of carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide was removed, the Hill reaction was inhibited. Increased concentration of carbon dioxide at low levels led to a stimulation of the Hill reaction [Stern: 1961]. As stated previously by Medlyn et. al, very high levels of carbon dioxide in the leaves was associated with lower photosynthetic rates, likely due to its competition with nitrogen for binding sites [Medlyn: 2002]. For these reasons, we believe that the 50:50 samples would have demonstrated the highest photosynthetic rates, while the carbonated water and distilled water samples would have lower rates. Since the chloroplasts were isolated, we believe that the issue of carbon dioxide concentration competing with nitrogen would be a non-issue. At a certain concentration of carbon dioxide, the photosynthetic rate would likely reach a peak, where the limiting reactant would be DCIP, ATP or excited electrons, which would determine the rate. 
	Future studies may include a pH buffer solution to ensure that the pH of the carbonated water will not alter the color of the sample when reacted with DCPIP. It is possible that a different color indicator could also be used. More research into the effect of carbon dioxide levels on photosynthesis rates could help us understand how carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may be helping or hindering photosynthesis of plant species on Earth. Specific research could be done to determine the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to optimize photosynthetic rates. This research could help mitigate some of the climate change problems we are facing [Walker: 1995].
