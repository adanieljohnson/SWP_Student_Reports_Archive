Title: The Effect of Light Wavelength on the Movement of Physarum polycephalum in a Culture

Abstract:
Phototaxis is a behavioral movement Physarum polycephalum exhibit when light is exposed in their environment. This behavior normally causes the cyanobacteria to move away from the light source, since Physarum normally survive in the dark. White light is only one type of light wavelength. In this experiment, the effect of different light wavelengths, specifically red and blue light, on the phototaxis of Physarum was tested through the measurement of distance in comparison to the normal phototaxis movement of white light. We predicted that blue light would cause Physarum to move farther away from the light than white light, while red light would cause movement closer to the light origin than white light. Using color specific light lamps and PDA Physarum cultures, and a controllled area of light, we measured the distance the Physarum travelled. From the data collected, the red-light showed statistically significent data, while blue light showed no statistically significent. We can conclude white light and blue light move the Physarum about the same distance away, due to a similarity in shorter wavelengths, while red light causes the Physarum to move in the opposite direction, closer to the light due to similar light conditions (wavelength) to a dark environment.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum, or more commonly known as slime mold, is an organism that is found in dark and highly humid environments. Physarum tend to live in the plasmodial stage of life using actin microfilaments to crawl around to find food and dispose of waste. This organism is known for having a multinucleate syncitium, which is a mass of nuclei under one plasma membrane, and function/undergo mitosis all at the same time, making it one large cell [Johnson: 2018]. Another characteristic of this organism is that when it is in normal environmental conditions, dark and humid, the Physarum’s nuclei are in a diploid form, yet when a harmful environment condition is introduced (heat, light, chemical agent, or lack of food), the organism’s reproductive cycle starts, moving the organism around toward or away the newly added condition [Johnson: 2018]. Both features allow for Physarum to be an easily grown and observable specimen to study signaling pathways and behaviors without a microscope.
One behavior of Physarum in response to environmental factors is called phototaxis. Phototaxis is the process of moving positive (towards) or negative (away) from a light source [Johnson: 2018]. Different species of Physarum avoid light when it is introduced into a dark environment, growing toward the opposite direction [Bialczyk: 1979]. This reaction to light in the environment occurs due to light being a stimulus, acting as a signal for the organism to move. The ordinal light signal causes an increase in production of cAMP in the cells, which speeds up cell movement of the cyanobacteria in relation to the light source [Miura: 2000]. Essentially, this allows of the Physarum to initially move away/reproduce away from the light to the darker environment that it normally lives in for its survival.
The environmental condition of light is not in only one wavelength; it is a spectrum of different wavelengths, from visible to infrared to ultraviolet. Even visible light contains many colors/wavelengths, like red light which has a longer wavelength and blue light which has a shorter wavelength. When placed into both red and blue light environments, the Physarum showed negative phototaxis to blue light and positive taxis to red light, showing that the longer shorter wavelength caused movement away from the light, and the longer, showed movement towards the light [Hato: 1976]. With this in mind, the goal of our experiment is to test and determine if different light wavelengths, specifically red and blue, impact the distance the Physarum moves. We think that if exposed to both light conditions, the Physarum polycephalum will move farther away from the blue light source, similar to phototaxis of white light, and be closer to red light, the opposite of white light. This occurs due to red light having a longer wavelength, and less energy (closer to darkness), while blue light has a shorter wavelength and more energy.

Materials and Method:
To start this experiment, 14 PDA plates were obtained (food is available everywhere), with lids. Of the 14 plates, 1 plate was put an all-light condition (negative controll), 1 plate was placed in a dark condition (positive controll), 4 plates were exposed to white light, 4 plates to blue light and 4 plates to red right. Equal variance is used in the sample size, providing 8 replicates for each test condition (besides positive and negative controll). A slab transfer method was used in order to place Physarum into each of the wells drawn. To do this method, metal spatula and forceps were to cut and remove the two 1cm x 1 cm squares out from the wells. This was done to all the PDA plates, with sterilization of the tools in ethanol after each cut. 1 cm x 1 cm squares of Physarum were cut out of a Physarum culture and transferred to the wells created (28 wells, 2 wells per plate). After the Physarum are placed in the PDA plates, the lids were taped down to the plate and each plate was wrapped in foil (except the plate labelled all light). 
For the white light, blue light, and red-light test groups a 0.5 cm square window was cut in the foi. Under the designated light lamp, each test group was placed, making sure the small windows are receiving light. The negative controll all light plate was placed under the white light, and the dark plate was placed in a black bag in a drawer. The plates were allowed stay in these conditions for 48 hours. Once 48 hours passed, the distance the Physarum moved in millimeters was recorded by measuring the current edge of migration to the closer edge of the original slap (negative numbers represent a distance closer and positive numbers represent a distance away). After recording the measurements, the averages and standard deviation was found, and two one-tailed two sample t_test an alpha/significance level of 0.05 comparing both the red and blue sample to the white light were completed.

Results:
After measuring the distances travelled by Physarum in each of the test conditions, the averages and standard deviations of each test group were found. The average distance travelled of the white light test group was 4.42857143±2.57275098 mm [Figure 1]. The average distance travelled of the red-light test group was -2.7142857± 3.14718317 mm [Figure 1]. The average distance travelled by the blue light test group was 5.57142857±5.5032458 mm [Figure 1]. One thing to note is that originally there was eight replicates to collected data from, but one replicate in each was thrown out, due to the Physarum block moving of the well. Both positive and negative movement (towards and away from light) was recorded through negative (distance towards) and positive (distance away) values. A one-tailed two-sample t_test was conducted comparing white light to red light (P-value=0.000281, d.f.=12, t-value= 4.649068). Another one-tailed two sample t_test was conducted comparing white light to blue light (P-value=0.313833, d.f.=12, t-value=0.497737).

Discussion:
After looking at the average distances the Physarum moved when placed under different light wavelengths, we can conclude that part of our hypothesis was supported. When blue light is placed on the slime mold cultures, the mold moved around the same distance as the white light, not supporting our hypothesis that it would move farther. A two-sample one-tailed t_test was completed and showed no statistical significance. No statistical significance signifies that blue light and white light move the Physarum around the same distance away from the light source. When red light is placed by the Physarum, the slime mold moves closer to the light, rather than farther away, shown in the white light, supporting our hypothesis. After a two sample one-tailed t_test was completed for white light and red light, statistical significance was found. Overall, we can conclude that Physarum moves around the same distance away from blue and white light, while in red light, the Physarum moved a smaller distance towards the light [Figure 1].
	When looking at other studies conducted with similar variables and organism, the results showed similarities to our results. In a study on phototactic orientation in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum, it was found that when using lateral light, lower wavelengths showed positive phototaxis and higher wavelengths showed negative phototaxis [Häder: 1984]. Another experiment showed that negative phototaxis for high-intensity broad-spectrum light showed maximal movement away from light, specifically due to the blue light in the broad spectrum. When looking at blue light specifically, a maximal movement is shown by the cyanobacteria used in the experiment, compared to a positive phototaxis movement, shorting the distance away from the light [Ng: 2003]. Both of these experiments show a similarity in results to Physarum response to different wavelengths of light. 
Reasons for this type of response from the Physarum comes from an idea of different photoreceptors and energy available. As explained before, the red-light wavelength shows longer waves with less energy, simulating a condition closer to darkness, while blue light waves are shorter with more energy, similar to white light waves. These wavelength conditions could have caused the Physarum to move a similar distance with the blue and white wavelength, while showing a completely different distance movement with the red light. In a study conducted on cAMP mediated photo signaling, it was found that there is a decrease in cAMP content in red light and increase in cAMP content in far-red light [Ohmori:2007]. We can conclude that cAMP controlls the phototaxis response to blue light and white light moving the Physarum away from the light source, while red light causes a different signal response (decrease in cAMP causing movement towards the light), possibly indicating a different receptor is responsible for movement of Physarum with red light.
In an experiment conducted on slime mold sensors, it was found that Physarum is able to recognize the difference between red and blue light, by measuring the electrical potential oscillation in the slime mold; energy given off [Adamatzky:2013]. This suggests different receptors available for the different wavelengths of light, specifically red and blue. These different receptors could cause different reactions of the Physarum leading to moving closer to red light and moving farther away from blue light. Further experimentation and research would need to be conducted in order to see if there really are different photoreceptors used to cause such a distinction in movement.
Slime mold, or Physarum polycephalum is normally found in dark and damp places, which could include basements, underground, gardens, woods, etc. With the knowledge of phototaxis movement, we can use lights to move and distribute sections of slime mold, in the wild, in order to remove or utilize the behaviors of the organism. Red light could be used to attract the mold to a certain spot, since it causes the organism to move towards the light, while blue or white light can be used to cause movement away. These behaviors to different lights would be useful in getting rid of slime mold growth, or directing growth away from certain areas in order to lessen damage caused by the organism or remove it completely.
