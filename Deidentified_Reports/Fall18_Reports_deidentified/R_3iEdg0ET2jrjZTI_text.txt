Title: Allocation of Resources in Fagopyrum esculentum Under Light and Dark Conditions

Abstract:
Plants are often subject to various environmental changes that cause shifts in resource allocation. In many cases, sunlight is an energy source being restricted. Plants that receive restricted amounts of sunlight must prioritize where it will allocate its resources. This experiment analyzes root:shoot growth ratios of Fagopyrum esculentum placed in light and dark environments to determine if a lack of sunlight induces a change in resource allocation. The root:shoot weight ratio of Fagopyrum esculentum placed in direct sunlight were significently affected; however, their root:shoot length ratio was not. In conclusion, our hypothesis was supported since the root:shoot growth ratios of plants placed in dark conditions were significently different when compared to a controll group.


Introduction:
All plants require sunlight to survive. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into usable energy to allocate resources towards growth and reproduction. This experiment focuses on how plants allocate resources when placed in light and dark conditions. Fagopyrum esculentum, commonly referred to as buckwheat, is the sample species being used for this experiment. Historically, buckwheat has been harvested as a good dietary source of rutin, “a flavonol glycoside synthesized in higher plants as a protectant against ultraviolet radiation and disease.” [Kreft: 2006] Alterations in energy allocation patterns under various environmental conditions are known to facilitate plant growth. [Robinson: 1988] However, it is also known that changing environmental conditions that directly restrict energy allocation will simultaneously restrict resource intake. [Chapin: 1991] This experiment focuses on how Fagopyrum esculentum react and allocate energy to growth in environments lacking sunlight. Buckwheat plants with restricted amounts of sunlight will be unable to absorb energy through photosynthesis. This, in turn, will cause the plants to make a shift in resource allocation. Buckwheat plants placed in an environment lacking sunlight will have significently different root:shoot ratios than plants placed in direct sunlight. 


Materials and Method:
A sample of 20 plants was first divided into two groups of 10 and randoMly assigned to either the “light” or “dark” experimental group. The “light” samples served as the controll group, while the “dark” samples were the experimental group. The light group was placed in a greenhouse to receive direct sunlight, while the dark plants were covered with foil to prevent contact with sunlight. The plants for each group were then monitored and watered regularly for a week before gathering data. For data collection, each plant was weighed individually to record a total plant mass before being cut at the intersection of the roots and shoots. The mass of the root and shoot systems for each plant was then weighed and recorded separately. Next, the root and shoot systems of each plant were measured for length. Finally, the average root:shoot weight and length ratios were calculated for the light and dark groups before being run through a 2 tailed 2-sample T-test to test for statistical significance.


Results:
The root:shoot weight ratios of the light group (mean=0.099, s.d.=0.043) and dark group (mean=0.16, s.d.=0.072) were found to be statistically significent (t-value=2.11, d.f.=18, p_value=0.042). The root:shoot length ratios of the light group (mean=0.87, s.d.=0.29) and dark group (mean=0.68, s.d.=0.19) were not statistically significent (t-value=1.74, d.f.=18, p_value=0.099). The root systems of the experimental group generally weighed more than those of the controll group, as seen in Figure 1. However, the plants placed under dark conditions did not have a notable difference in root length compared to the controll group. Additionally, the plants in the experimental group appeared to be a darker shade of green compared to the controll group after the one week period. 


Discussion:
My hypothesis was supported, as the root:shoot weight ratios of plants placed in a dark environment was significently different than those placed in direct sunlight. After restricting the experimental group’s intake of sunlight for one week, the samples appeared to have a lower root:shoot weight ratio. However, my results would have yielded better results had there been a larger sample size for each experimental group. Additionally, some plants may take more than one week to reallocate resources after receiving a stimulus. [Bazzaz: 1997] Therefore, I believe my results would have been more pronounced had the experiment had a longer duration. In a natural environment, it is not uncommon for a plant to receive low amounts of sunlight due to taller surrounding tree canopies. In such a case, it may be advantageous for a plant to prioritize its energy towards shoot growth, as to “overtop” neighboring plants. [Givnish: 1988] These results display an interesting of plant behavior: the ability to make a decision over what to prioritize when a certain resource is lacking. In the future, it may be interesting to see what other survival mechanisms plants employ in order to cope with resource deprivation.
