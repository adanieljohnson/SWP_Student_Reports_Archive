Title: Inhibiting the Manduca sexta caterpillar’s molting process by injection of azagaurd to restrict 20E. 

Abstract:
In this experiment we housed eight different Manduca sexta caterpillars in their larval stage. We had two different group, a controll and an experimental. We fed the experimental group food with azgaurd, a 20E inhibitor, in it. The caterpillars initially developed at the same rate, however, as the controll began to develop they grew much faster and bigger than the experimental caterpillars. The experimental caterpillars inevitably never reached a molting phase and three of the four died. This lab write up details the specifics of this experiment and provides more detail on the specifics regarding the procedures and findings.  

Introduction:
Insect molting is controllled and regulated by two hormones that work in unison. These two chemicals are JH (juvenile hormone) and 20E (20-hydroxyecdysone). JH is normally present during larval life to allow growth of the larva and the progression from one larval stage to the next until the larva attains a proper size for metamorphosis [Riddiford 2003]. The two hormones, JH and 20E were discovered by Wigglesworth in 1934 and Hampshire and Horn in 1966 respectively. [Riddiford 2003]. In order to study the impacts of these two chemicals simultaneously taking place in early development we elected to study the Manduca sexta caterpillars, specifically in their pre-molting state. The Manduca sexta were an ideal choice because they reach pupation in a very short amount of time and are easily kept and monitored without great difficulty. We used a chemical, azagaurd, to inhibit the production of 20E in the molting process. The major role of 20E is, when the prothoracic gland is triggered it provokes the secretion of ecdysone, which within 12-15 hours triggers the gut purge and other prodromes of metamorphosis. [Nijhout 1974]. By inhibiting this serious of processes (the sequential fall from ecdysone being triggered to the visible molting seen on the physical caterpillar) we expected that using azagaurd to limit or expel the secretion of ecdysone would lead to caterpillars unable to molt and thus growing to be larger than average. [Nijhout 1974]. We hypothesized that, by adding azagaurd to the food eaten by our experimental group we would see that the experimental caterpillars grew to be smaller than our controll caterpillars, and furthermore, the inhibited caterpillars would not reach pupation. 

Materials and Method:
We collected eight total caterpillars. We attempted to find caterpillars of similar size and weight in order to make data more consistent and straight forward. We separated out these caterpillars into two groups of four, placing them in plastic containers with four sections keeping every caterpillar separate, with the controlls in one box and the experimental in the other. The first group was our controll group. This group was fed 10g of caterpillar food per caterpillar. Food was added anytime it dried out or seemed to be running low. In our experimental group we fed the caterpillars the same 10g of food, adding as needed, however we placed 4 drops of azagaurd in the food and mixed the chemical in every time we fed them food. (adding food only in 10g increments). We then weighted the caterpillars every day for two weeks (missing three days towards the end of the experiment), as well as recorded qualitative observations about the color and activity of the caterpillars. After the two-week experimental period was over we discarded of the caterpillars and their food and complied the data into graphs. We looked at the average difference in weight between the start and end of the experiment of the controll group versus the experimental group. We also looked at the average difference of peak weight to initial weight between controll and experimental groups. This data is compiled later in this report. 

Results:
The controll group all reached pupation. The controll group experienced a steep spike in weight, followed by a steady decline and then a visible pupation at a weight above their original weight but significently lower than their max weight. The experimental group experienced a gradual increase in weight that experienced no spike and then descended with about the same slope as the increase and left the caterpillars at a similar weight to the weight at which they began. Three of the experimental caterpillars died with none of them reaching pupation. The three caterpillars who died by the end of the experiment took on a brown color, similar to the color of the pupated caterpillars in the controll group, however, other than the color there were no signs of pupation in the experimental caterpillars. The descriptions of the caterpillars can be seen in the qualitative tables in the chart in figure 1. The average difference in weight in grams from start to finish for the controll was 2.52  .78 (t_stat = 6.45, d.f. = 3, P= .007), for the experimental it was .63  .92 (t_stat = 1.37, d.f. = 3, P= .265). For the average difference in weights in grams from start to max weight for the controll was 6.77  1.38 (t_stat = 4.45, d.f. = 3, P = .021), and for the experimental it was 2.13  .97 (t_stat = 9.77, d.f. = 3, P = .023) . See Figure 2,3,4,5. 

Discussion:
Our results supported our hypothesis. We saw that the experimental group developed and grew to be smaller in weight than our controll group. Furthermore, we saw our entire controll group pupate, while not a single caterpillar in our experimental group pupated. This confirms our hypothesis. The reason we saw the results line up with our hypothesis is because of the basic fact that we knew that inhibiting 20E in the larval stages of the Manduca sexta caterpillar would result in smaller size and inhibit the caterpillar from pupating. This happens because the azagurd restricted a spike in ecdysone, called a commitment pulse, that traditionally comes in the second week of the caterpillar’s life that would normally signal the caterpillar to begin pupation. [Progress in Neurobiology 2003]. There is also traditionally a spike in 20E at the very beginning of the larva’s life that triggers the initiation of the instar period. It is difficult to say whether or not we began feeding the caterpillars azagaurd early enough to have impacted this initial spike, and it is likely that we did not. However, that would be an explanation for why the experimental caterpillars experienced such less weight change. By limiting the ecdysone allowed, we restricted the caterpillar’s ability to progress through the different instars and this impacted the caterpillars weight gain. Furthermore, there was no decrease in weight gain, because there was no increase to begin with, and the decrease in weight could not act as another trigger to pupate. [Nijhout 1974]. At this time, it is hard to determine why the three caterpillars died and one of the experimental looked completely normal. An explanation is that the experimental caterpillar that did not die did not have even enough 20E to consider pupating, while the other three did. The three who did may have begun preparation for pupation, thus explaining the color change, and then in the process the lack of 20E impacted a critical point in which the caterpillars died. This would make since, as the experimental caterpillar, who remained alive, appeared to have made no attempt
