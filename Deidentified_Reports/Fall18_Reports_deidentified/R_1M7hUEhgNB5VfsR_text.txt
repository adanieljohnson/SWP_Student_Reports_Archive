Title: The Effects of Methoprene on the Manduca sexta Caterpillar does not include an Abnormal Increase in Weight and Length

Abstract:
The growth of the Manduca sexta is controlled by a group of hormones known as juvenile hormone (JH). The presence of JH prevents the caterpillars from maturing and pupating. Martin’s Insect Growth Regulator, methoprene, is a JH analogue. It was hypothesized that when ten drops of this hormone analogue is added per ten grams of the Manduca sexta caterpillar’s diet, that there would be an observed increase in length and mass of the subjects. In order to test this hypothesis, eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were observed in two groups that were fed different diets. The control group saw a greater increase in growth than did the experimental group. The average change in weight for the control group was 7.22 (g) whereas the average change in weight in the experimental group was 5.05. For length, the average change of the control group was 2.33(cm) and the average change of the experimental group was 1.1. The Two-Sample T-Test resulted in a p-value that was insignificant for both weight and length. Thus, although negative effects were observed on the Manduca sexta caterpillars, the expected effects of increased weight and length were not observed, nor significant in the experiment’s findings. 


Introduction:
Insect growth regulators, commonly referred to as IGRs, are becoming an important part of a new approach to the use of pesticides, which focuses on the specialized targeting of organisms and their physiological processes. These IGRs are insecticides that mimic hormones that are present in the juvenile life stages of specific insects. By targeting the specific biological processes of insects, the opportunity arises to control these organisms that are pests without harming other biological factors in the environment, by means of toxic pesticide use. The regulators have been observed to show rarely fatal results in mature insects, but they can prevent reproduction of insects that are known pests [National Pesticide Information Center: 2015]. The Manduca sexta, more commonly referred to as the Tobacco hornworm, is an organism that becomes a pest to crop production when in its juvenile stages of life. This insect undergoes a complete metamorphosis, meaning that it consists of a very active, ravenously eating larvae that pupates in an inactive form [Lakna: 2017]. One of the primary groups of hormones that controls the growth and development of these insects are the juvenile hormones. There are many different types of hormones that are classified under the group of juvenile hormones, but they all generally function in the same way. Juvenile hormones are present when the Manduca is a caterpillar, but their absence is what then triggers pupation at the final instar stage. Martin’s IGR, methoprene, is a juvenile hormone analogue that is used to mimic the effects of the juvenile hormones on the Manduca caterpillar. Methoprene is a hormone that pre-exists in the physiological processes of the Manduca caterpillar, but artificial varying levels of the hormone in experimentation has been observed to alter and achieve the desired negative effects on the physical maturation processes of the caterpillar. When ten drops of the Martin’s Insect Growth Regulator, methoprene, is added per ten grams of the Manduca sexta caterpillar’s regulated diet, then there will be an observed increase in length and mass of the subject caterpillars. 


Materials and Methods:
The experiment included eight Manduca sexta caterpillars, which were split for comparison into two groups of four caterpillars: consisting of a control group and an experimental group. The caterpillars were kept in two, four-cell containers which were placed in a temperature-regulated environment, with consistent lighting. Eighty grams of Manduca diet was measured out (10 grams per caterpillar) and then split into two dishes. The first dish of Manduca food (40 grams) was mixed with 40 drops of di water, in order to match the consistency of the food given to the experimental group. This dish, mixed with the water, was then split evenly into four sections, and the food sections were placed in each of the four cells of the container for the control group caterpillars. The other 40-gram portion of food was then mixed with 40 drops of Martin’s IGR methoprene. This food, after being thoroughly mixed, was then evenly split into four sections and placed in the four cells of the experimental group’s container. The caterpillars’ food was monitored daily, and if it appeared to be dry then it was replaced with a freshly mixed 10 grams of food. The caterpillars were then monitored daily, and their individual weights and lengths were recorded for nine days. Observations of the caterpillar’s health and appearance were also noted. A table was created online in order for the group to record and keep track of the raw data and observations acquired daily. In order to analyze the data acquired, the value of the total change in length and weight for the caterpillars throughout the entire experiment was used as opposed to the entirety of raw data recorded on a daily basis. This information was then submitted in a Two-Sample T-Test format, in order to obtain a p-value, and therefore significance of the results. A Two-Sample T-Test was chosen for this analysis, because of the presence of data collected from two independent groups: the control group and the experimental group. 

Results:
Significant growth in weight and length in the control group was observed throughout the experiment. Growth, in weight and length, was also observed in the experimental group of caterpillars, but when compared to the growth of the control group it was seen that the growth was not of abnormal range. The average and standard deviation in weight for the control group was 7.2225 ± 2.569 grams whereas the average change and standard deviation in weight in the experimental group was 5.045 ±3.963 grams, as shown in Figure 1. For length, the average change and standard deviation of the control group was 2.325 ±0.699 centimeters and the average change and standard deviation of the experimental group was 1.1 ±2.005 centimeters, as shown in Figure 2. The length of the caterpillars in both groups would sometimes vary, being shorter than, or not consistent with the day prior. Yet, an overall average increase in length was still recorded for both groups of caterpillars as displayed in Figure 2. A Two-Sample T-Test was used to analyze the results of both variables. Upon using this test, the change in weight of the experimental group was not found to be significant in comparison to the change in weight of the control group, yielding: p-value = 0.392, t-value = 0.922, Df = 6. This test also displayed that the change in length of the experimental group was insignificant in comparison to the change in length of the control group, yielding: p-value = 0.292, t-value = 1.154, Df = 6. These results are indicated in a clearer format in Tables 1 and 2. The expectation was to see an abnormally high increase in weight and length for the experimental group of caterpillars. Overall, a trending increase in both the weight and length variables was recorded for the experimental group, but when compared to that of the control group we can see that the result was different than what was expected. 


Discussion:
The weight and length variable comparisons in the Two-Sample T-Tests resulted in p-values that indicated that the results were not significant. This was unexpected, because the hormone used in the experiment was a juvenile hormone, so it was hypothesized that the caterpillars would continue to grow in length and weight as they were given the hormones that caused them to fail to mature. In natural biological circumstances, juvenile hormones circulate in the insect and control the development of an insect. The level of juvenile hormone decreases as the insect ages, which allows the juvenile insect to progress through successive instars [Amateur Entomologists’ Society: 1997-2018]. Due to the excessive presence of juvenile hormone in the experimental caterpillars’ diet, the caterpillars weren’t allowed to progress fully through their successive instars, to the pupation stage. PTTH, or prothoracic hormone, is released from the brain of the insect in order to start the process of pupation. The actual release of PTTH occurs at the first period that juvenile hormone has disappeared from the haemolymph, or blood of the insect. The remaining presence of juvenile hormone in the haemolymph, a functional failure of this normal mechanism, is apparent to be responsible for the developmental standstill [NijHout: 1974]. Therefore, in this experiment the growth of the experimental group of caterpillars was stunted, as opposed to the expected increase in growth, because of the lasting presence of the juvenile hormones. In order to further test and confirm the effects of the juvenile hormones on the Manduca sexta caterpillar, a larger experiment should be conducted in which there are multiple experimental groups and the hormone is applied to the experimental caterpillars’ diets in different variable amounts, and in different stages of their development, separated by the different experimental groups. Thus, the exact effects of the variable amounts and timing of the hormones could potentially become clearer when the different experimental groups are compared to the control, and to each other. This would be important information to have for the study of pesticide use, so that a targeted pesticide can be developed that creates the specific desired effects on the Manduca caterpillar that will control its presence as a pest, without harming the environment in which it lives by means of toxic pesticide use.
