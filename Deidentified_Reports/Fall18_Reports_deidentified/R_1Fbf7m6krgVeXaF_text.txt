Title: The Effect of Cold Temperature and Room Temperature Environments on Time of Contact for Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Aggressive behavior is an essential component of competition and survival between animals in increasing fitness and dominating territory. Our experiment analyzed factors that impact aggressive behavior eventually leading to attack for the Betta Splendins fish. Six fish were obtained and separated into 3 groups of 2. 6 trials total, 3 for cold temperature water and 3 for room temperature water were conducted in which the group being tested were put in the same water, and the amount of time it took for attack and thus contact to occur was measured. A paired t_test was used to analyze and compare the calculated mean time before contact between the two treatment conditions. It was hypothesized that the amount of time for attack under cold water conditions would be significently longer than the amount of time for attack under room temperature water conditions. The collected data disproved the hypothesis, yielding statistical values that did not show a significent difference in the average time of attack between the two conditions. 

Introduction:
Aggressive behavior in nature is multifold in purpose, including increased fitness, territory dominance, and competition for resources and mates [Johnson: 2018].  Use of aggressive behavior allows for advancement of certain individuals over others in terms of the factors previously listed. In the aggressive behavior patterns of the Betta Splendins fish, escalating facing and broadside movements eventually lead to contact through directed attack. Certain factors and reinforcements such as food, or amount of time between encounters of fish may impact the nature of aggression between fish [Hogan: 1970]. In a study examining the effects of water temperature on survival of trout in basic life functions, it was found that colder water temperatures significently decreased rate of survival of trout [Jonsson: 2010]. An additional study examining the ability to perform life functions such as territorial dominance also found that temperature of environment directly impacted abundance of fish populations over time [Kuczynski: 2017], with these results supporting the previously mentioned case study as well.  In our experiment, the mean amount of time before aggressive contact between 3 groups of 2 fish in two different conditions of room temperature water and cold water was compared to analyze how differing temperatures of water may impact the rate of aggressive behavior leading to physical contact upon attack. It was hypothesized that Betta fish in cold water temperature conditions would have a higher mean time before attack compared to the Betta fish in room temperature water. 

Materials and Method:
6 Betta Splendins fish were acquired and split into 3 groups of 2. Each group was put through a trial in the room temperature water conditions, at eighteen degrees Celsius,  in which the fish were put together and the amount of time it took for physical contact to occur upon attack was measured. Ice cubes were then slowly added to the tanks holding the fish and temperature was monitored until it reached fifteen degrees Celsius. The same procedure was then repeated for the 3 groups under cold water conditions. The times were measured in seconds and the mean time was calculated for each condition. The data was analyzed using a paired t_test to determine statistical significance between the two mean time values between the two treatment conditions. 

Results:
The mean time of contact for the Betta fish under room temperature water conditions was 122 seconds ± 24.75 seconds(Figure 1) and the mean time of contact for the Betta fish under cold temperature water was 143 seconds ± 28.02 seconds(Figure 1). Utilizing these results, we calculated a t_statistic value of 1.295, with a p value of 0.325 and 2 degrees of freedom. Thus, there was not a statistically significent difference in the calculated means of the treatment groups. The appearance of the fish during the different trials under the two different conditions did not have any significent observational difference. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis of the experiment was not supported and thus disproved because the data, seen in Figure 1 as well as the results of the statistical test, did not yield a significent difference between the time of contact between the fish upon attack between the groups under trial of cold water conditions versus trial under room temperature conditions. These results did not support the previously mentioned case studies, as the temperature of water did not correlate with a significent difference in behavior of the Betta Splendins fish under trial. It can thus be inferred that decrease in water temperature by a few degrees does not impact the amount of time of contact upon attack between aggressive Betta fish. Other factors in environment or directed stimuli do impact the aggressive behavior of Betta Splendins fish, however.  A recent study investigating the effect of the drug Fluoxetine on aggressive behavior of the fish yielded a significent difference in expression of aggressive behavior of the male betta fish being tested [Lynn:2007].  Investigating how these fish react in terms of temperature and environmental conditions is essential in that although these fish are domestic species in large proportions, optimizing living conditions and understanding impact of changes in environmental conditions to favor natural behaviors is important as this knowledge can be applied to the wild portion of the species in their respective environment. Furthring this experiment could include repeating it with significently colder temperatures to see if extreme changes impact time of contact, or using different stimuli to understand what factors significently alter aggressive behavior in these fish.
