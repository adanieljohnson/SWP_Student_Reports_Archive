Title: The Effects of Sunlight Variation on Root to Shoot Ratios in Pisum Sativum

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to determine the effect on the growth of field peas (Pisum sativum) amount of sunlight has. Sunlight is very important in the growth of plants because it is what allows photosynthesis to occur and that is how plants acquire energy. The field peas (Pisum sativum) were grown in an area of natural sunlight or increased shade, and it was hypothesized that those in more sunlight would have increased growth. The results did support the hypothesis because there was a significant difference in the root to shoot values (growth) between the shaded and not shaded plants. 


Introduction:
In this experiment, we are studying field peas (Pisum sativum) and the effect that varying amounts of sunlight has on the growth of the plant. Field peas are a small annual legume that is rather common. Sunlight is known to have an important role in the role of photosynthesis in plants. Photosynthesis takes place in the leaves and stems of plants and is important for the acquisition of energy that is required for processes within the plant. Each plant has a delicate balance between amount of leaves and amount of stem. Plants use the energy gathered through photosynthesis for many things including growth (Johnson 2018). Growth will be determined by measuring the root to shoot ratio. The root to shoot ratio will be determined for both length and weight. It is hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio will be different if the field peas are planted in an area of more sunlight as opposed to more shade. 

Materials and Methods:
	First, we located field pea seeds and then planted 16 seeds in a pot, watered, and fertilized them; this was repeated 5 other times in order to have 3 control and 3 treatment, which were labeled accordingly. The three control plants were placed in normal sunlight in the greenhouse. The three treatment plants were placed in the greenhouse, but under a black mesh covering to limit the light. For two weeks, the plants were watered 100mL per pot. After that time 12 plants were selected from each group, making sure to take four from each pot, which were then picked and separated from the soil using water, while making sure to keep the plants separated into their respective groups. All the plants were then cut to separate the root and the shoot. The root and shoot weight and heights were then measured in grams and centimeter, and then recorded in a table in excel.


Results:
The root to shoot ratio for weight was significantly different in those plants in an area that was shaded (t-stat: 2.75, df=22, p=0.012). The root to shoot ratio for length was significantly different in those plants in an area that was shaded (t-stat: 3.83, df=22, p=0.00092). 


Discussion:
Based on the data collected, the hypothesis of a different root to shoot ratio of plants in an area of more sunlight, was supported. This most likely occurred because the lower the root to shoot ratio the more shoot per root, which is expected because sunlight has direct effects on the growth of plants because of the energy plants gain from the sun. The statistical results for weight and length were both significant as the p-value from the two-sample t-test was less than 0.05. An area of possible error in the experiment could have been the fact that during the first week the plants were not watered for three days because of the hurricane. 
A previous study about the effect of light on wild rice growth showed that there was an increase in biomass with an increase in sunlight, specifically in this study by 34%. Those findings support the findings of this study that there is a relationship between sunlight and growth (Sims et al. 2012). Further research could be conducted on the same topic, but with varying species and amount of sunlight to improve the conclusions drawn from this study about growth.
