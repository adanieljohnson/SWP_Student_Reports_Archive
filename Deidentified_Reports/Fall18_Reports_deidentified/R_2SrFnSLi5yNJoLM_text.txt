Title: Effects of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist on the contraction of frog gastrocnemius

Abstract:
In the experiment we used three frog legs to study the effects of the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist Tubocurarine on the contraction of the frog gastrocnemius. Muscular neurons require ACh to work as the neurotransmitter to transfer the signals to the muscle fibers in order to produce muscle contraction. Using three frog legs as the control group, we detected the normal muscle contractions. Then we proceeded the same experiment with the injection of Tubocurarine in the gastrocnemius and compared the response voltages between two groups. It was hypothesized that the injection Tubocurarine would cause a decrease in the response voltage amplitude from frog gastrocnemius muscle. The result p-value was 0.0586 and the conclusion was the application of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist would decrease the response voltage amplitude from frog gastrocnemius but the effect was not significant. We could set a larger data base or change the volume of the antagonist solution for further study to get a more conclusive effect. 

Introduction:
Both in vertebrates and invertebrates, there are skeletal muscles to support the animal body and the skeletal muscles are made up of thousands of myofibers which are the smallest complete contractile systems [Johnson: 2018]. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons and the axons of the neurons extend into a muscle and then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. At a neuromuscular junction, the motor neuron transmits the signals to the myofibers and causes the contraction. In this process, a neurotransmitter acetylcholine(ACh) is used to transmit the signals. When an action potential arrives at the axon terminal, the axon terminal allows calcium ions to rush in and trigger the fusion of ACh vesicles with the presynaptic membrane [Johnson: 2018]. The ACh molecule binds to its receptors and then the myofibers create the action potential to initiate the muscle contraction. However, the receptors on the myofibers could be influenced by the injection of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist to the muscle group. In the experiment, the antagonist we used was Tubocurarine. Tubocurarine is the prototype non-depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant [Clarks: 2018]. Its function is to paralyze the muscle groups. At low concentration, the antagonist competes with ACh for binding to postsynaptic nicotinic receptor sites in the skeletal muscle neuromuscular junction [Clarks: 2018]. With the understanding of the role of ACh in the process of muscle contraction and the function of Tubocurarine, we had the hypothesis as if we apply the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist Tubocurarine to the frog gastrocnemius muscle, the response voltage of the muscle will decrease. 

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs of similar sizes are selected for the experiment. Grasp the skin of the legs and separate the inner thigh muscles to free the sciatic nerve from its attaching connective tissue. Moist the whole leg with Ringerâ€™s solution to maintain the muscle contractile ability. Then attach the probe to the sciatic nerve and hang the gastrocnemius, which is isolated from the connective tissue by cutting through the Achilles tendon, to the hook on the instrument. Open the iWorx software and apply the stimulus current of 0.1A, 0.2A, 0.5A, 1.0A, 1.5A and 2.0A with frequency of 5Hz to the sciatic nerve. Record response voltage amplitude for each stimulus on the myogram. Then use the syringe to inject 1mL of 1mM of Tubocurarine solution to the gastrocnemius muscle at different positions. Wait for at least five minutes. Repeat with the same stimuli and record the amplitudes on the myogram for the response voltages. Repeat the same steps with the other two frog legs and choose two highest values from the same stimulus for each group for each leg. Determine the p-value using the paired t-test because the comparison is between the same leg, which works as both the control and experimental group. 

Results:
We used the highest values for each of the three legs. For the first leg, we had two values at the 0.5A; for the second leg, we had the values at 1.0A; for the third leg, we had values at 1.5A. As shown in the figure 1, the response voltages of the control groups were much higher than those of the experimental groups. Also, frog leg 2 had the lowest response voltages in both groups, for control it was 0.037V and for experimental it was 0.023V. For frog leg 3, it also had the highest response voltages in both groups, for the control was 0.063V and the experimental was 0.028V. For frog leg 1, whose values were between  the other two pairs of values, had the control as 0.047V and the experimental as 0.024V. The p-value was 0.0586. 

Discussion:
Usually in the biology experiment we use significance level of 5% in the t-test. The p-value we obtained in the experiment was 0.0586 and since it was larger than 5%, we rejected the hypothesis that if we apply the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist Tubocurarine to the muscle, the response voltage from the muscle contraction will decrease. However, 0.0586 was very close to 5% and we concluded the difference between the responses from the control and experimental group was marginally significant. 

The response voltage revealed the level of muscle contraction. The reason why we used the muscle contraction amplitude as the indicator was because muscular contraction was taken as an index of the propagation of the impulses across the impaled region [Ichiji:1952]. We compared the values of three legs and discovered there were obvious decreases between control and experimental values. By assessing the response voltages of the muscle, we knew the degree of the propagation of impulses so that we could speculate the effects of the antagonist on muscle. Some of the ACh receptors lost their functions because they were blocked by the Tubocurarine. The number of effective neurotransmitters in the neuromuscular junction decreased. However, even though the number of neurotransmitters decreased, there was still muscle contraction because the action potential was an all-or-none response. 

Also, there was another reason why we could still conclude Tubocurarine will decrease the muscle contraction amplitude. The frog leg 2 was pale and in lack of blood compared with the other two legs. As a result, the responses created by this frog, both the control and experimental values, were much lower than the values of other two legs at the same stimuli. It might be due to the frog had been dead for a long time and the muscles were in lack of ATP to continue the muscle contractions. Or the other reason was the frog was sick and was not able to perform normal muscle contractions. In order to reduce the influences of frog leg 2 on the final result, we used three frog legs both worked as control and experimental group because each individual was different. Also, we used three legs to reduce the probability of the abnormality such as frog leg 2, in this case. If leg 2 had operated normally, we might have gotten a smaller p-value to accept the hypothesis. 

However, even though we injected the antagonist to the muscle, there were still responses from the muscle because the volume we injected was not enough to block all the ACh receptors. For further study, we can change the volume of ACh receptor antagonist we inject to see if it is enough to obtain zero response from the muscle since all the ACh receptors are blocked. Also, at the meantime, we can increase the number of frog legs to reduce the influences of the deviations from each individual leg.
