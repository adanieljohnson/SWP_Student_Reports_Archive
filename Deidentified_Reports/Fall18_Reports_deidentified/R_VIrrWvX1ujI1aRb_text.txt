Title: Inhibition of Growth in the Manduca sexta with azadirachtin

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta pupation is controllled by a hormone called ecdysone which is produced in the prothoracic gland. Azadirachtin inhibits the release of ecdysone so by adding azadirachtin to the food of the Manduca sexta we can expect to see inhibited growth which will be measured in grams. The results of the experiment did not support our hypothesis with a p_value of 0.0686 to an alpha value of 0.05 in a one tailed t_test. A significent experiment result could potentially be attained in future experiments with higher levels of azadirachtin. 

Introduction:
Our experiment focuses on the Manduca sexta and the effect of azadirachtin on growth inhibition.  The Manduca sexta is a caterpillar native to North Carolina and is also called the tobacco hornworm.  The Manduca sexta is considered a pest as they eat the tobacco grown by many farmers in North Carolina.  The caterpillar has an average life cycle of 37-46 days. Pupation generally occurs around 20 to 23 days after birth.  After pupation, the caterpillar is no longer considered a pest. The hormone that controlls the pupation process is ecdysone which is produced by the prothoracic gland. The chemical azadirachtin, derived from the Indian Neem tree or Azadirachta indica, [Mordue: 1993] inhibits ecdysone which controlls the molting process of this caterpillar so that ecdysone levels stay low in the caterpillar. A similar study was conducted by Chowdhury on the Spilosoma obliqua a similar caterpillar with a molting process.  During the experiment the catepillars growth was “significently inhibited” by the addition of a 1: 1 turmeric oil and azadirachtin mixture [Chowdhury: 2001]. This study and the knowledge that ecdysone is responsible for the molting process leads us to believe that the addition of azadirachtin to the food of the Manduca sexta will inhibit the growth of the caterpillar which will be measured in grams. 

Materials and Method:
The 8 caterpillars were kept in 2 separate plastic containers with four separate sections. Each section was number 1 through 4 and had holes punched into the sides for ventilation. One container was labeled for the controll group and the other for experimental treatment. The containers were kept in an incubator with 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness at 28 degrees C. Each group was fed daily and given new food if they were running low or food was dry. The experimental group was fed 10g of food with four drops of azadarachtin 1: 1250 and the controll was fed 10g of food with four drops of water. The food was check daily to ensure it was moist and that there was enough food. If the food had gone dry or had been almost entirely eaten it was replaced following the above specifications. When food was being checked each day the caterpillars’ weight was taken using a small electronic scale and boat, then placed back into its respective compartment of the container. The difference between day 1 and day 14 was taken averaged and put through a 1 tailed t test with an alpha of 0.05.

Results:
The average difference in mass of the controll group is 1.93g with a standard deviation of +/-0.301. The averaged difference in mass of the experimental is 1.01g with a standard deviation of +/-1.01. There were 6 degrees of freedom. The one tail t test yielded a p_value of 0.0686. Graph 1.1 shows the average differences and standard deviation.

Discussion:
The results of the t_test were not considered to be significent and therefore did not support the alternative hypothesis. This experiment did not provide enough of a difference between the mass of the controll and experimental group to determine that azadirachtin inhibits the growth of the Manduca sexta. The amount of azadirachtin used was extremely small. A future study could be conducted with a higher level of azadirachtin to achieve significent results. Another change to be made could be the route of administration of azadirachtin to the caterpillar. The study by Timmins injected the Manduca sexta with the azadirachtin and had results supporting the inhibition of growth [Timmins: 1992].  Azadirachtin is a product of the Neem tree which is known to effect the growth of insects and feeding habits and may have other products that could be exploited for the use of pest controll. The oil of the Neem tree seed has other active ingredients such as salannin and salannol [Schmutterer: 1990].  Using one of these other active ingredients found in the neem tree or a mixture of active ingredients may prove to be more effective at extremely low doses as used in our study which would keep costs to a minimum for farmers.
