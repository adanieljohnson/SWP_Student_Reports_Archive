Title: Implication that Temperature Does Not Affect Photosynthesis Activity of Spinacia Oleracea Chloroplasts

Abstract:
In this experiment, the goal was to explore the relationship between photosynthesis of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv Savoy) chloroplasts and the temperature. The signs of climate change have been observed in recent years. Some evidence has revealed that the global average temperature is gradually increasing. Spinach, a common agricultural plant, is rich in chloroplasts, which makes it a perfect experiment subject to study how changes in temperature would affect the photosynthetic activities of the chloroplast. The participants used the Hill reaction as the indicator to monitor the photosynthetic activities. It was hypothesized that if the temperature is decreased, the rate of photosynthesis of the spinach chloroplasts will increase. The enriched spinach chloroplasts were kept at different temperatures, and photosynthesis rate would be recorded every 10 minutes by measuring the absorbance. However, the participants were unable to find statistically significent differences between sample groups. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Further testing is needed to produce a definitive conclusion. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a crucial biological pathway that allows plants to harvest light energy to fix carbon and produce sugar, which releases O2 as a waste product. Nearly all living organisms on the earth depend on this biological process [Lambers: 2008]. Plants collect the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce sugar which will fuel the biological activities of nearly all organisms in the ecosystem. Herbivores will eat plants; carnivores consume herbivores; microorganisms live on the deceased bodies. The food chain builds upon the photosynthesis. During the photosynthesis, the CO2 molecules in the atmosphere enter the plants’ leaves through the pores called stomata. The chloroplasts which are in a tight array could capture the solar radiation, which excites electrons. These excited electrons are then used to create a proton gradient and produce ATP molecules. The ATP molecules combined with high energy electrons are then used to synthesize glucose molecules from CO2 molecules in the atmosphere which enter the plants’ leaves through the pores called stomata [Lambers: 2008]. Hill reaction, which is the process of transferring electrons, is a necessary pathway for the photosynthesis [Arnon et al.: 1956]. Photosynthesis activity is complicated, which make it relatively difficult to monitor its activity level directly. However, Hill reaction, an unavoidable step of photosynthesis, is relatively easy and reliable to be tracked. Therefore, the Hill reaction can be utilized as a tool to measure photosynthetic activity. DCIP, a blue substance, could be used as an alternative electron acceptor in the Hill reaction. When DCIP is reduced, it becomes colorless. By measuring the absorbance of the reaction solutions, the photosynthetic activities could be monitored. Temperature would affect the light-independent reactions of the photosynthesis. Light-independent reactions are dependent on a series of enzymes. Elevated temperature would post the risk of denaturing the enzymes and interrupt the photosynthesis. Plants have different optimal temperatures which would allow them to grow better. A study has shown that spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv Savoy) grows at 5 °C would show signs of increased dry mass, thicker leaves, and larger leaf areas [Boese & Hunter: 1990]. This suggests that 5°C is the optimal temperature for the spinach chloroplasts to conduct photosynthesis, which allows the spinach to fix carbon at a higher rate; thus, it generally grows better. The experiment participants want to further explore the relationship between the photosynthesis and temperature. Since the higher temperature would likely decrease the reaction rate of the light-independent reactions due to protein denaturation, it is logical to infer that a lower temperature might allow the spinach chloroplast to have higher photosynthetic activity. It is hypothesized that if the temperature is decreased, the rate of photosynthesis of the spinach chloroplasts will increase. 

Materials and Method:
The dried spinach leaves, whose veins were previously removed, were grinded in 10 Ml of cold 400 mM pH 8.0 grinding buffer using a set of cooled mortar and pestle. Another 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the ground spinach leaves. Then the spinach slurry was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. The filtered liquid was then centrifuged at 200G for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and then centrifuged again at 1000G for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed. Then the pellets were resuspended with 20 Ml grinding buffer. 13 test tubes were prepared. 6 Ml of water, 2Ml 100 mM pH 6.5 phosphate reaction buffer, and 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP was added to 12 test tubes. Three test tubes were kept at 0°C ice-water mixture, three at 25°C (room temperature), three at 35°C water bath, and another three test tubes at 45°C water bath. Then 100 μl of enriched chloroplast was added to these 12 test tubes and mixed immediately. A blank was made by mixing 8 Ml of water, 2 Ml of reaction buffer and 100 μl enriched chloroplast. The spectrophotometer was blanked, then the absorbances of the solutions in the 12 test tubes were measured at 600 nm at time 0. The spectrophotometer was re-blanked, and the absorbances of the solutions in the 12 test tubes were measured at 600 nm after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. The absorbances at 10, 20, and 30 minutes were then compared with the time 0 absorbance by calculating percent change using the formula [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at the time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%. The data was then analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test with an alpha value of 0.05 to compare the differences in photosynthesis activity of the chloroplast in different temperatures.

Results:
The data displayed in Figure 1 does show that the chloroplasts kept in 0-3˚C tend to have higher percent change than samples kept in higher temperature. The statistical test shown in Table 1 and Table 2 indicates that there was no statistically significent difference among percent change among sample kept in different temperature at 10 minutes and 30 minutes mark. For 10 minutes mark, the degree of freedom is 3 among the group, 8 within the group; the Fs value is 2.356; the p_value is 0.147. For 30 minutes mark, the degree of freedom is 3 among the group, 8 within the group; the Fs value is 1.976; the p_value is 0.196. At the 20 minutes, there is a statistically significent difference in percent change between the 0-3˚C and 25˚C as indicated by Table 1 and Table 2. The degree of freedom is 3 among the group, 8 within the group. The Fs value is 5.664, and the p_value is 0.022. 
Note: (1) All raw data was included in the statistical analysis including the potential outlier. (2)Test tube number 10 (45˚C) shows the usual discoloration after 10 minutes; it was dark green instead of blue.

Discussion:
The null hypothesis that if the temperature is decreased, the rate of photosynthesis of the spinach chloroplasts will not change cannot be rejected. The goal of the experiment is exploring whether photosynthesis would be affected by environmental temperature. At 10 minutes and 30 minutes, there was no statistically significent variation in the percent changes among samples at the different temperature. However, at 20 minutes, the data suggests that percent changes of absorbance at 0-3˚C is statistically higher than the percent changes of absorbance at 25˚C. The p_value from the statistical test is 0.022, which is smaller than 0.05. But this statistically significent difference alone cannot definitively suggest the effect of temperature on the photosynthesis activity of spinach chloroplasts. However, despite the lack of statistical significance, the data does show that the chloroplasts kept in 0-3˚C tend to have higher percent change than samples kept in higher temperature, which indicates 0-3˚C have more active photosynthetic activity. This corresponds to the findings of other studies done in the past. It is evident that the spinach chloroplasts, when kept in low temperature, do have the higher rate of photosynthesis within few hours; but in a long period such as few days, the coldness would inhibit the photosynthesis [Somersalo & Krause: 1989]. In our experiment, the spinach chloroplasts were kept in different temperature for 30 minutes, which theoretically should allow the chloroplasts to have higher photosynthesis rate in low temperature during the experiment. One potential error contributes to this result could be the lack of controll over how much light was facilitated to the chloroplasts during the experiment. Samples at 35˚C and 45˚C were kept in two different water bath. Both of the water bath machines have tinted lids or solid metal lid, which were kept closed during the experiment. However, the samples kept in 0-3˚C and 25˚C were left in the open without obstruction from the light source. The previous study has suggested that the quality and quantity of the light have a strong correlation with the photosynthesis rate [Platt & Jassby: 1989]. Specifically, the light saturation would significently affect the photosynthesis rate of plants. Each type of plant has a different light saturation point, which is the light intensity level that allows the plant to reach the optimal photosynthetic rate. When plants are kept in the light whose intensity is below its light saturation point, the photosynthetic rate will not reach its full potential. The lack of controll of the intensity of the light source essentially introduces the second variable to the experiment besides the temperature. In the future, the experiment participants could conduct two separate experiments in which light intensity and temperature are the only independent variables respectively. This should reveal more about the characteristics of the photosynthetic activity of the spinach chloroplasts with more conclusive results.
