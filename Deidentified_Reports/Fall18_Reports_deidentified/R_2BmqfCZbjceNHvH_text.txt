Title: The Effect of Caffeine on Physarum Signaling Pathways

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum, also known as slime mold, exhibits complex behaviors when met with environmental stimuli through signaling pathways. The cAMP mediated pathway uses cAMP as a second messenger. cAMP then binds to the final effector which changes the cell in order to respond to the stimuli. The effects of caffeine, compared to no caffeine, on the physarum’s cAMP mediated pathway will be observed through the addition of a caffeine solution to the experimental Physarum. The movement of the Physarum towards 4 oats in both the controll and experimental will be measured after twenty four hours. It was hypothesized that the experimental Physarum would show a greater growth toward the oats. The data showed that the controll grew an average of 3.67mm towards the oats, while the experimental Physarum grew an average of 35.67mm. The greater distanced traveled by the experimental Physarum emphasized the role as caffeine as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, inhibiting the breakdown of CAMP. The lack of CAMP breakdown allowed for the signaling to continue and the physarum to continue responding to the stimuli. Further emphasizing the role of second messengers in a cells response to external stimuli.

Introduction:

	Physarum polycephalum, or more commonly known as slime mold, is a multinucleate syncytium organism. Multinucleate syncytium organisms are made up of multiple nuclei within one plasma membrane [Sakai 2018]. The mass of Physarum is referred to as a plasmodium and behaves like one cell in its functions such as synchronous mitosis of all nuclei. Slime mold spends the majority of its life cycle in the plasmodium stage, which consists of flat yellow netlike plasmodium. [Sakai 2018]. In the Plasmodium stage, physarum searches for food by using its microfilaments and oscillating the cell thickness in order to extend its leading edge to reach the food source [Takamatsu et al.] . Although the movement of slime mold may be simple, it exhibits complex behaviors when met with environmental changes. Physarum polycephalum is a helpful organism to study as many of the organism’s cellular processes are synonymous to that of a human. Slime mold allows for the observation of the processes on a viewable level without the need of a microscope.  [Sakai 2018]
	When the physarum responds to its environment, it uses intracellular signal transduction pathways to respond to the environmental stimuli. The two main pathways used by Physarum are pathways using G protein-coupled receptors and pathways using ion coupled receptors. Furthermore, the two main type of G protein-coupled receptors are the cAMP-mediated path and the IP3-mediated path. In the cAMP mediated path, the G-protein coupled receptor is stimulated by an external stimulus, causing part of the G protein to leave as a second messenger. The G protein then activates Adenylate Cyclase, an effector enzyme that converts ATP into cAMP. The cAMP can then travel through the cell and bind to different substrates, causing change and respond in the cell. The pathway only stops when cAMP is broken down by phosphodiesterase [Sakai 2018]. 
	The behavior of the Physarum through signaling pathways allows for a complex response of the Physarum to environmental stimuli. The Physarum were put in environments containing caffeine and controll environments in order to determine and observe the effect of caffeine of the Physarum pathways, specifically the cAMP mediated pathways. Based on previous research, caffeine inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase. [Murray 1971] Without phosphodiesterase, the cAMP would never be broken down and the signal pathway would continue to respond to the environmental stimuli (the food). Therefore, it was predicted that the Physarum with caffeine would grow a greater distance towards the food than the Physarum without caffeine.  


Materials and Method:
To begin, six, 100mm empty 2% water agar plates and a 2% water agar plate containing the organism, physarum, were acquired from the TA. Flat tipped forceps, 50Ml of ethanol, and a metal spatula were also acquired. Three of the plain water agar plates were labeled controll, while the other three were labeled experimental. In each plain water agar plate, a block measuring 1cm by 1cm was first measured and drawn with sharpie marker on the back of the plates. Then, the block was cut out of the water agar using a metal spatula and removed with forceps. A block of agar containing physarum, measuring the same size, was cut out from the physarum agar plate and placed into the empty square in the plain agar plate. Between each removal of a physarum water agar block, the metal spatula and forceps were disinfected with ethanol in order for each block to be uncontaminated and dried with a kimwipe. 
Then the caffeine solution was made using 1Ml of 20x stock caffeine liquid (1Ml Caffeine aliquots) and 19Ml of deionized water. Following the creation of the solution, 4Ml of the 1x solution was added into each of the three agar plates labeled experimental. The solution then dried for 20 minutes in order for the caffeine solution to soak into the agar base. Once dried, 4 pieces of oats were added to all 6 of the plates. The plates were then taped in order to secure the top and bottom of the plates and wrapped in tin foil and once again labeled controll or experimental. All 6 plates were then put into a black bag labeled with the groups names and put into the class incubator at 72 degrees. 
	The plates were removed from the incubator 24 hours later and examined. The Physarum’s growth was measured using a mm ruler and the direction of the physarum in relation to food was determined as either toward, away, or no direction if no growth was seen. A two sample T-test was then used to analyze the data.


Results:
The experimental Physarum showed a greater average movement towards the oats with an average distance of 35.67mm, while the controll Physarum has an average distance towards the oats of 3.67mm. The p value was determined to be 0.000734, which is less than 0.05, and therefore statistically significent. The confidence interval was above 95% and therefore statistically significent.



Discussion:
Physarum polycephalum, or slime mold, is a multinucleate syncytium organism that spends most of its lifetime in its plasmodial stage. As a plasmodium, the slime mold moves, searching for food by extending the microfilaments at the edge of it’s yellow netlike body. The Physarum shows complex behaviors when presented with environmental changes and stimuli. These mature responses are due to the signal response pathways that the Physarum uses to respond to changes and adapt to its environment. Specifically, the cAMP signal pathway was manipulated through the addition of caffeine and the response of the Physarum was observed.
 It was hypothesized that the Physarum with caffeine would grow more than the Physarum without caffeine as caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase and prevents the cAMP from being broken down and the signal pathway to stop. [Murray 1971] The hypothesis was supported. The experimental Physarum show far greater growth toward the oats with an average distance of 35.66 mm, compared to the controll’s average growth of 3.67 [Figure 1]. When growth was seen in both samples, the growth was towards the food. The greater growth of the physarum exposed to caffeine shows that the experimental group responded to the environmental stimuli greater than the controll. 
In previous studies, caffeine in Physarum is believed to inhibit phosphodiesterase at the plasmalemma which would cause a greater level of cAMP. [von Olenhusen and Wohlfarth-Bottermann 1979].  The caffeine prevented the breakdown of cAMP and therefore the signal pathway did not stop, causing the physarum to continue responding to the stimuli and grow at a greater rate and for a greater distance than the controll. 
A way this study could be improved would be to vary the amount of caffeine that the Physarum received to observe whether the growth would vary among the samples. Another improvement on this study would be to add other stimuli to the agar plate other than just caffeine and oats. For example, the plates could be put in both light and dark conditions to see whether the light would alter the effect the caffeine had on the cAMP-mediated path.
