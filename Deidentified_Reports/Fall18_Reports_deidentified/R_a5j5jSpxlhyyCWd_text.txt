Title: Male and female Betta splendens response time to another betta of the same sex with and without the presence of food

Abstract:
Animal behavior is studied in order to draw connections and evolutionary significance between and within species. In this particular study, we were observing both male and female Betta splendens with and without the presence of food in order to determine what males and females respectively are more motivated by for optimum survival: the presence of another betta of the same sex or food availability. We observed a male in the presence of another male and a female in the presence of another female and recorded when the two fish took notice of each other, then we added food to those same conditions and recorded at which time the two fish noticed each other. We found that males and females differ in the time it takes for them to notice each other with food present, and that females display a difference in notice time with food versus without food. We hypothesize that these results would be due to the fact that males invest more in reproduction than females and thus must be more aware of the imminent threat of attack to protect their territory and their nests.



Introduction:
In this experiment we studied Betta splendens, common aquarium fish that originated in Southeast Asia. Males display a wide rage of aggressive behaviors against other males of the species which make Betta splendens excellent organisms of study, along with the fact that they display sexual dimorphism [Snekser: 2006]. Their reactions are easily quantifiable and relatively predictable at the base level which we can use as a foundation to experiment on. Males do not do live in groups because they must fight for their own individual territory to build bubble nests in for their young, since males put more effort into their reproduction than do the females [Justus: 2018]. Interestingly, female bettas are much less aggressive; in fact, when given a choice, female bettas prefer to live in groups [Snekser: 2006]. Continuing forward, biological fitness is defined as the ability an organism has to survive and reproduce, thus in this experiment, we were attempting to determine what male and female Betta splendens consider their largest threat to optimum fitness, either obtaining food for survival or fending off potential threats to reproduction (respectively). We quantified our data by measuring how long it takes for the fish to notice each other in the presence of food and without it. We believed that females would notice the food immediately since food shortage is likely the larger threat to survival for females than is the presence of another female. Still, since females do prefer to live in groups, we predict that they will notice each other eventually due to their emphasis on group living but only after food is obtained. On the other hand, we predicted that males would remain aggressive with one and other regardless of food availability and will become alert immediately after being exposed to another male in any circumstance. In short, we hypothesize that there will be a significant difference in response time to each other between males and females with and without food.


Materials and Methods:
First, we obtained two divided fish tanks with water. In one, we had one male betta fish on each side of the divider and in the other we had one female on each side. One layer of the divider was clear and one was opaque. We removed the opaque portion of the divider in each tank and recorded the behavior of the males and females respectively for five minutes. Specifically, we recorded at what time the fish noticed one and other, approaching the divider, and for males, displaying aggressive behaviors. For females, we quantified when they noticed one and other by counting when the two fish came face to face at the glass divider and remained there for at least five seconds. We did this three times with five minutes of rest between each testing period during which we put the opaque dividers back in place. Next, we removed the opaque dividers from each tank while also placing food into each side of the divider and recorded the behaviors of the males and females. Again, we noted at what time the fish noticed each other. We did this three times with five minutes of rest between each repetition. Finally, we used an ANOVA test to calculate the means of each group and the one-tailed p value. We evaluated our results using an alpha of .05. We used a Tukey-Kramer test to determine which groups showed a significant difference between each other. 


Results:
Results: The p value shows a significant difference (p=.000017). The females took the longest of any group to notice each other when they had no food. The averages (in seconds) are as follows: (AVG= 29.77, 15, 216, 61). The standard deviations are as follows: (STDDEV=9.29, 5, 31.45, 25.16). The letters above each bar denote significant differences. 


Discussion:
Figure 1 gives support to our initial hypothesis. However, there are a few caveats. We observed that male bettas still displayed aggressive broadside behaviors even while eating. This could further be explained by the fact that, since males put more effort into reproduction, the success of hatchery is also largely dependent on access to nutrients found in food, and the males may have been attempting to feed themselves in order to gain strength to prepare for potential offspring in the future [Sipauba-Tavares: 2016]. Still, the females took much longer to notice each other in the presence of food than did the males, thus showing that males are more aware of the possibility of competition even when there are nutrients available. We believe that this could be due to the fact that males need to fight for territory against other males to build bubble nests for reproduction whereas the fitness of a female is not impacted by this factor; they need food more than a territory to reproduce [Justus: 2018]. To support this, we could study the behavior of a male and a female together with and without the presence of food in order to determine if males show the same level of aggression during feeding when a female is present instead of a male. Males invest more into reproduction than females, but since females are also necessary for said reproduction, we could determine whether or not males value their own territory and food over the desire to have a potential mate. In previous studies, females have been deterred by overly-displaying males [Clotfelter ED: 2006]. Similarly, overly vigorous males also have fewer eggs in their nests, thus males have an incentive to not show overly ambitious aggressive movement in the presence of potential mates [Clotfelter ED: 2006].
