Title: Effects of Ecdysterone Inhibition on Growth in Length and Weight of Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The objective of the experiment is to determine how Azaguard, an Ecdysterone (20E) inhibitor, affects the larval growth of Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm. 20E is a prominent hormone in many insects, mainly ones that go through metamorphosis. Because of this, there is great importance behind research in 20E and other insect hormones. The effect of 20E blocking in Manduca sexta can be applied to many other insects in their molting behaviors and patterns. Our data suggests that the introduction of 20E inhibitors, such as Azaguard, decreases the average weight and length of the larvae, resulting in detrimental health effects to the larvae. The applications of the results of our study include the possible creation of new pesticides and other chemicals to combat insect infestations. inversely, it also can assist biologists with knowing how to take care of insects and keeping them unexposed to potential threats, such as 20E inhibitors.

Introduction:
In the experiment, the effects of Azaguard on Manduca sexta growth was tested.  Azaguard acts as a 20E inhibitor. 20E is a group of insect hormones that regulates time of molting and relies on transcriptional agents [Adams:2000]. Azaguard disrupts transcription of code for proteins that induce molting and because of this, pupation is impossible for the larvae treated with Azaguard. This particular molting between the larval and pupal stages are what the experiment focuses on. Pupation is caused by cellular changes in the epidermis of larvae, induced by 20E [Riddiford:1977]. There are two doses of 20E that leads up to full pupation of Manduca sexta larvae. The first dose results in the discontinuation of larval feeding, while the second dose causes the pupation to begin [Riddiford:1977]. Inversely, juvenile hormone (JH) is what induces different types of molts and functions while insects are in their larval stages. The correct balance of JH and 20E is required to cause pupation. Because of this dependence between pupation and 20E, the hypothesis formulated states the that the larvae would not undergo pupation and, furthermore, the larvae would still grow as a result of continued eating, resulting in a larger average weight and length for the experimental group. 



Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta larvae were divided up into two groups of four larvae. Each group was separated into its own plastic container with four compartments. Each compartment housed one larva. One group had all four larvae given 10 grams of food along with 10 drops of water. All food and water was replaced in exact amounts to the nearest 100th place after both were depleted. The other group’s larvae were given 10 grams of food and 10 drops of Azaguard. All food and Azaguard was replaced when depleted. The food was weighed in a plastic boat on a standard lab balance, and both the water and Azaguard was transported using a micro-pipet. Every day the caterpillars were weighed (g) and measured (mm) by the researchers (excluding 4 days due to inclement weather). Each larva was weighed using a standard lab balance, and each larva was measured using a centimeter ruler. Statistical analysis of the data received throughout the experiment was done via two-sample t-tests. A two-sample t-test was conducted for both comparing weight and comparing length between the control and experimental groups.

Results:
The average weight for the control group was far larger than the average weight throughout the experiment for the experimental group, with the control group’s average weight being 3.53g and the experimental group’s average weight being 1.16g throughout the experiment (Fig. 1). Similarly, the difference in average weight at the end of the final day is 4.17g (fig. 1). The standard deviation for the experimental weight is 0.20 and the standard deviation for the control weight is 2.27. As with the weight, the control group’s average length throughout the experiment is larger than the experimental group’s (47.71mm and 39.56mm respectively) (fig.2). The difference between the average length on the final day is 11.3 mm (fig.2).  The standard deviation of the lengths of the control group was 9.68 and the standard deviation of the lengths in the experimental group was 4.14 (fig. 2). The 2-tailed p values for the two-tailed t-test conducted on length and weight respectively were 0.024 and 0.004. 

Discussion:
While the p-values collected indicate that the data is statistically significant, our hypothesis was rejected due to the fact that the difference in the data between the control and experimental group was the exact opposite of what we stated in our hypothesis.   Because the average weight and length of the experimental group treated with Azaguard was significantly lower than the weight and length of the control groups, the p-value was statistically significant. Our hypothesis was that the experimental larvae would be much larger than the control group in both weight and length. We would see similar p-values between both scenarios, which explains the statistically significant result from the t-test. The control group had significantly larger average weights and lengths, and because of this, our hypothesis that stated the group of larvae that was exposed to Azaguard would not pupate and continue to grow larger than the control group cannot be supported, similar to Adams’ and Kingan’s results. This is likely due to the effect Azaguard has on direct inhibition 20E secretion cells [Adams:2000]. However, it is important to note that, while our group was incorrect concerning the growth of the larvae, the experimental group had no pupations while all surviving organisms in the control group did This is due to the reduced eating caused by the awaiting pupation that never happens [Riddiford:1977].  Also, interestingly, the standard deviation in the weights of both control and experimental groups was relatively small to the experimental and control length’s standard deviation. This is likely due to the difficulty in straightening the larvae out to measure them. Because at times this was impossible, many of the lengths recorded were likely inaccurate, resulting in a much higher standard deviation for both the control and experimental group. Another setback in the experiment was our inability to access our lab during hurricane Florence. Because of this, we were unable to identify how quickly the drop in weight of our control larvae experienced, which was observed between the 8th and 9th day.
