Title: The Significant Effect Martin’s IGR has in the Development Rate of the Manduca Sexta Over Time

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta caterpillars depend on the two hormones known as Juvenile Hormone and Prothoracicotropic Hormone for growth and development.When an imbalance in the Juvenile Hormone is present, the Manduca Sexta fails to pupate. In the lab, Martin’s IGR was added to the food source of four out of eight Manduca Sextas. It was hypothesized that the addition of Martin’s IGR to their diet would affect the maturing rate of the Manduca Sexta. This hypothesis was supported by the results of the experiment. Data showed a significent difference between the controll Manduca Sexta and the experimental Manduca Sexta. The experimental Manduca Sexta failed to mature past the fifth instar larval stage.

Introduction:
The hormones present in the Manduca Sexta that allow it to molt and develop are the juvenile hormone, prothoracicotrophic hormones, and ecdysteroids. The juvenile hormone works with ecdysterone to allow cellular processing and molting to occur. The presence of juvenile hormone in the Manduca Sext prevents it from molting, therefore the level of juvenile hormone must decrease and the level of ecdysteroids must increase for molting to occur. Martin’s IGR is an insect growth regulator. IGR’s are known to cause abnormalities that prevent insects from completing a full life cycle because they interrupt biological systems.  In a study conducted to determine the effect of IGR on pest controll, it was predicted that species that relied on Juvenile Hormones for maturation would instead become excessively large, and/or produce extra larval, nymphal, or pupal forms [Staal: 1975].  Laboratory results in the experient previously mentioned, displayed that the Manduca Sexta who had IGR in their body system, excessively ate, causing them to be much larger than the Manduca Sexta who had no IGR in their body system [Staal: 1975]. Although these Manduca Sexta developed much more rapidly, they failed to molt when the controll Manduca Sexta did. It is expected that the Manduca Sexta who consume Martin’s IGR will also fail to molt. The purpose of the experiment is to determine the effect Martin’s IGR would have on the biochemical functions of the Manduca Sexta and how these changes would affect the Manduca Sexta Physically. It is hypothesized that Martin’s IGR will have a significent effect on the maturing rate of Manduca Sexta. This is predicted because the purpose of an IGR is to inhibit the growth development of pests. This means that the experimental group will most likely not pupate.

Materials and Method:
Eight, 11- 12 day old Manduca Sexta caterpillars were selected and divided into two groups, controll and experimental. Each Manduca Sexta caterpillar was placed into their own separate cubicle within their group. Four of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars were fed 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet with 10 drops of water each. The other four Manduca Sexta caterpillars were fed 10 g of GLM diet with 10 drops of Martin’s IGR. All M. Sexta caterpillars were kept in the same incubator kept at 28°C, in 12 hours of dark, 12 hours of light cycle. Once a day the M. Sexta caterpillars were measured by weight, length, and observations were recorded. When food had been fully consumed the GLM diet with 10 drops of either water or Martin’s IGR was replaced

Results:
Major differences were seen between the controll group and the experimental group Manduca Sexta. After two weeks, the controll group M. Sexta were a bright green color and were very plump and swollen. The magnitude of experimental M. Sexta 2’s growth value was found to be much larger than the controll group despite starting off with as the smallest in both weight and length. This trend is supported by Figure 3. A significent drop in the weight and height of experimental M. Sexta number 4 is also displayed in figure 3. M. Sexta in the controll group ate less and had formed a pupae by the middle of the second week of results. In figure 1, the controll group M. Sexta had lost both mass and length as opposed to the M. Sexta in the experimental group who had exponentially gained both mass and length by the end of the two weeks. Figure 2 demonstrates that the M. Sexta in the controll were found to have lost length and that the M. Sexta in the experimental group has gained length. Figure 3 demonstrates each M. Sextas growth in both mass and length from Day 0 to Day 14. M. Sexta number 1 in the controll was found to have the largest lost in weight. M. Sexta number 2 in the experimental was found to have the largest growth value in both mass and length. Lastly, M. Sexta number 4 in the experimental was found to have the smallest growth value in weight and length. The average weight of the controll group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (t_stat=1.76, d.f.=22, P=0.0915). The average length of the controll group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (t_stat=1.96, d.f.=22, P=0.0623).



Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that Martin’s IGR will that Martin’s IGR would have a significent effect on the maturing rate of Manduca Sexta was supported. Based off the two-tailed, two-sample t- test yielded a P values of 0.0915 for the mass and a P value of 0.0623 for the length, indicating that the results observed were caused by the experimental treatment. The data gathered in both mass and length of the experimental and controllled M. Sexta also supports the hypothesis because of the difference between both groups in the maturing and developing rates. One unexpected occurrence in the lab was discovery of mold growing in experimental M. Sexta number 4. After further investigation, it was concluded that water may have left in the container when fed which lead to the growth of the mold. The difference in appearance noticed between the controll group and the experimental group is supported by a variety of factors. The insect growth regulator, Martin’s IGR, is responsible for preventing the M. Sexta caterpillars from molting and pupating. Martin’s IGR mimicked the juvenile hormone typically released during the larvae stage. However, the continuous release prevented the caterpillars from pupating because the levels failed to decrease before the commit pulse was established. When pupation began in the controll group of the M. Sexta, food consumption concluded which explains the significent decrease in mass and length that occurred in days 7 and 8. It is predicted that the mold found in the container of experimental M. Sexta number 4 is the causing factor for the below average mass and length gain gathered. Based on the results of the two-sample t test, Martin’s IGR did not cause a significent mass and length gain in M. Sexta when compared to M. Sexta in the controll group.
