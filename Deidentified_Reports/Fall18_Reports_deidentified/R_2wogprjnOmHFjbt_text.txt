Title: The addition of calcium to a culture of Physarum polycephalum contained no growth

Abstract:
Organisms use signaling pathways to respond to stimuli. These responses refer to a change in behavior, such as an increase in the rate of growth. This experiment used calcium ions as the external stimuli that began the signaling pathway in a slime mold called Physarum polycephalum. The effects of calcium were tested by comparing the growth rate of P. polycephalum in different environments: one with an increase in calcium ions, another with EDTA+ and strontium chloride, and a control group with no added solutions. The hypothesis predicted that the growth of P. polycephalum will be the largest for the P. polycephalum that are in the presence of a higher concentration of calcium ions and the least amount of growth would be the P. polycephalum in the presence of EDTA+ and strontium chloride. The results did not correspond to the hypothesis as there was no growth for any of the treatment groups. 

Introduction:
Signaling pathways refer to molecules or ions in a cell that control one or more cell functions by working together. Often, a second messenger, which is an ion that helps trigger a response, is activated early in the signaling pathway. These ions are what bind to an effector to create a response to the stimulus that began the signaling pathway [Johnson: 2018]. To open calcium channels, a ryanodine receptor acts the same way as a second messenger. This receptor is a calcium receptor on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. When calcium from an external source enters the cell, it binds to the ryanodine receptor to open up calcium ion channels. 
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that is commonly used in lab experiments because it is easy to grow and it has a multinucleate syncytium. This means that the slime mold has multiple nuclei on its plasma membrane, allowing the observer to see multiple cell-level processes that are similar to that of humans without using a microscope [Johnson: 2018]. Thus, by observing the nerve network of P. polycephalum, we are better able to understand the nerve network and transduction pathways in humans as well.  P. polycephalum can live in two stages, plasmodial stage and sclerotium, which is a resting and hibernating stage. Furthermore, P. polycephalum moves through a process called cytoplasmic streaming when it is in it plasmodial stage. This is where actin and myosin interact to move the endoplasm back and forth to create a flowing motion. Actin and myosin are largely involved in the movement of P. polycephalum as they are involved in contraction, which is triggered when calcium ions bind to troponin, a protein involved in muscle contraction. Thus, cytoplasmic movement correlates with changes in concentration of calcium ions [Matthews: 1977]. In a study done by S. Hatano, it was stated that calcium is known to affect the movement of Physarum.  For example, if calcium is removed from the P. polycephalum, contractile movements ceased and when calcium was added to an immobile P. polycephalum, movement was restored [Hatano: 1970]. Thus, it was found that because calcium has a positive effect towards the mobility of P. polycephalum, it subsequently has a positive effect on the growth of the slime mold. This is because of the chemotaxis that slime mold exhibits in response to both an increase in calcium ions and the presence of food. Also, EDTA+ is a chelating agent that sequesters metal ions such as calcium. Calcium will remain in the solution, but by being bound to EDTA it exhibits diminished activity. Therefore, if it was added to a culture of P. polycephalum, calcium would not be able to function normally. Thus, we predicted that if there was an increase in calcium added to the environment that the P. polycephalum was contained in, then the slime mold would move and grow more within that environment and less in an environment that contains EDTA+ and strontium chloride. 

Materials and Methods:
The experiment began by preparing two dilutions. The first dilution contained 20 mL of distilled water and one mL of both EDTA+ and strontium chloride. The second dilution also contained 20 mL of distilled water in addition to one mL of calcium cations. Then, nine PDA plates, were split into three even groups: control, EDTA+, and Ca2+. The EDTA+ and Ca2+ groups were each soaked in five mL of their respective dilutions for ten minutes. PDA plates were used because it provides the slime mold starch and sugar. Next, forceps sterilized in ethanol were used to  cut nine one cm by one cm blocks in the slime mold stock. When the plates were done soaking, a one centimeter by one centimeter cube was cut in the middle of all nine plates and removed. In the empty cube of each plate, a cube from the slime mold stock was added. After the stock was added to all nine PDA plates, the plates were taped shut and placed in black ziploc bag which was then placed in an incubator for 48 hours. After 48 hours, the distance that each slime mold strand traveled was measured in millimeters using a ruler. The distance that each slime mold traveled for the different groups was compared to one another by using a one-way anova test with an alpha value of 0.05. 

Results:
The expected results would have shown the Physarum polycephalum growing more in the PDA plates that were soaked in the calcium ions than both the control and the plates soaked in EDTA+. Additionally, the plates that were soaked in EDTA+ and strontium chloride should have contained the least amount of growth. Rather, growth of P. polycephalum did not occur for any of the treatment groups. However, there was growth of a different bacteria on all of the calcium, EDTA, and control plates. A one-way anova test would have been used to determine if the results were statistically significant because the means of three independent groups were compared. For the results to be significantly significant, the p-value should be less than 0.05. 

Discussion:
P. polycephalum was expected to grow for all treatment groups because it was in the presence of starch and sugar that is ingrained in the PDA plates. This is because of the chemotaxis that slime mold exhibits as it is expected to move towards a food source. The P. polycephalum that was used may not have moved because it already had a food source in the cube that it was contained in. When the cubes were cut from the slime mold stock, the P. polycephalum was already grown on oatmeal pieces. Thus, when the cubes were places into the PDA plates, the P. polycephalum may have not had a reason to grow outward and exhibit chemotaxis towards the food because it already had enough quality food to feed on. This is examined in a study done by Tanya Latty. Latty examined how the quality of a food source affects the behavior of P. polycephalum. Her results indicated that the growth of  P. polycephalum had a positive correlation with increased food quality [Latty: 2009]. This means that P. polycephalum is more likely to grow and search for high quality food when in the presence of low quality food. Thus, if the slime mold already had good quality food from the oatmeal pieces, it did not have to move and growth to obtain more food from the PDA plates. 
Furthermore, although early research suggests that calcium helps increase the growth and movement of Physarum polycephalum, in a study done by Lauren C. Terry, it was found that calcium does increase the growth of P. polycephalum at first. After a period of time, however, calcium significantly decreased the growth of the organism [Terry: 2009]. This suggests that calcium has both an excitatory and inhibitory effect.The results from Terryâ€™s research suggests that although calcium enhanced growth for 48 hours, the decrease in growth over 24 hours was significantly greater than the increase in growth that occurred earlier [Terry: 2009]. According to Terry, this has to do with the concentration of calcium, as an increase in concentration of calcium led to more inhibitory effects.This indicates that the inhibitory effects of calcium are greater than the excitatory effects. This could account for why the P. polycephalum did not grow in any of the plates soaked in calcium. Additionally, in a study done by David Knowles, it was found that the mobility rate of P. polycephalum was reduced when nutrients that enhance growth and certain sugars were present. The results of this study suggests that migration rates decrease in the presence of glucose because of osmotic effects and the fact that glucose is metabolizable [Knowles: 1978]. Osmotic pressure would affect the rate of movement of P. polycephalum because osmotic withdrawal of water from the P. polycephalum from the agar plate shifts equilibrium to the agar, ultimately reducing the migration rate [Denbo: 1976]. Thus, the Physarum may not have moved because of the presence of the sugar in the PDA plates, . 
Additionally, the slime mold may not have grown because it was already in its resting state, sclerotium. This is the stage that P. polycephalum enters if conditions of the environment are unsuitable for the mold to grow. This can include a lack of food or a decrease in humidity [Johnson: 2018]. The growth of the bacteria in the plates was due to contamination from sources including the PDA plates, the excess solution that the plates were soaked in, and the air in the surrounding environment. Thus, the next logical step for this experiment would be to obtain a slime mold stock that is in plasmodial stage and does not already have a high quality food source available, while also being cautious of confounding variables that may cause bacterial growth. This will help us better understand how calcium affects the signal transduction pathways in both P. polycephalum and humans.
