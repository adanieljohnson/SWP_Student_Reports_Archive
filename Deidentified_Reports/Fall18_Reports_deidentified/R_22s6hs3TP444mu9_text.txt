Title: The effect of Light Color on the energy allocation of Buckwheat

Abstract:
	The effect of red light on energy allocation was tested using Buckwheat plants. Many plants are often grown under different colors of light posing the biological question: how will light color affect the root:shoot ratios of the plants? We hypothesized that the buckwheat grown under red light would, in comparison to the controll group, allocate more resources to its roots and capturing energy than investing in growth of its shoot. After growing the plants for 2 weeks under different light conditions, there proved to be no difference in the ratio of resources allocated to each portion of the plant by the different groups, however there was a noticeable difference in overall size, with the controll group plants being much larger. This result was probably skewed by the red-light group’s plastic filter trapping in heat and moisture, possibly supplying the plant with excess heat and water, preventing growth. Further experiments should be conducted to ensure the accuracy of this experiment’s results.


Introduction:
	Plants, like any organism, have limited resources available to them. A plant’s distribution of its resources is dependent on many environmental factors [Johnson: 2018]. Different colors of light are known to affect plant growth, with red typically being the most effective at spurring growth within filtered light colors and green the least effective, although this varies between plant species [McCoshum: 2011]. This difference between light colors is due to the different wavelengths of light that make up the different colors affects the production of different chemicals within the plant, in turn affecting the plant’s overall growth and structure [McCoshum: 2011]. Knowing that changing light color will affect how well plants are able to grow and produce certain resources, how will changing light color affect a plant’s resource allocation? To calculate this, the ratio between resources allocated to the roots and resources allocated to shoots of Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plants. A higher root-shoot ratio will typically mean that the plant needed to invest more in gathering energy while a lower root-shoot ratio typically means that the plant was easily nourished and could afford to allocate more towards its growth [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, The effects of receiving solely red light on the root:shoot ratios of buckwheat plants were tested. It was hypothesized that plants grown under red light will have higher root-shoot ratios than the plants grown under normal light.
HA: Root-Shoot ratios will increase under red light. 



Materials and Method:
We filled four plastic pots with potting soil, then put approximately 25 seeds in each pot, planting them just beneath the soil and spaced out within the pot. After placing the seed, we added 200Ml of miracle grow to each pot, then about 500 Ml of water to each pot. We then placed the pots in two larger, thicker plastic containers, then placed those in a greenhouse with one container holding two pots under normal sunlight and one container holding two pots under sunlight filtered through red plastic. We then left the plants in the greenhouse for the next two weeks, and gave them the same amount of water each day. In our experiment, the amount of water varied each day due to an inability to access the greenhouse during hurricane Florence. After two weeks, the plants were carefully removed from the pots using plenty of water and were washed, and from each pot 6 plants were selected at random (making 12 plants for each light color). The root lengths were measured from the tip of the root to the root-shoot junction, and the shoot lengths were measured from the root-shoot junction to the point where the leaves branch from the stem. The plants were then cut at the root-shoot junction and the leaf-stem junction and weighed the roots and the shoot of each plant. We used a two-tailed t_test to analyze the data we collected.


Results:
The mean root-shoot ratios for weight and length of the red-light group were not significently different from the ratios of the normal-light controll group. Weight: Stat = 0.714, d.f. = 22, p = 0.483. Length: Stat = 0.0467, d.f. = 22, p = 0.963. It is worth noting that even though the ratios were similar, the mean values for the root and shoot length and weight of red light plants was much smaller than that of the normal light plants. Figure 1 shows the comparisons of the average root:shoot ratios for weight and length for both the red light group and the normal light group, and Table 1 displays the same data but in table format, giving the exact numbers for the values displayed in Figure 1.


Discussion:
The data did not support our hypothesis because the root-shoot ratios were not statistically significent. Even though the root-shoot ratios were roughly the same, the mean of the weights and lengths had a noticeable difference. The red-light plants were on average much smaller than the controll group plants, but they managed to hold the same root-shoot ratio as the controll group plants. This contradicts findings in previous experiments, such as McCoshum et al. (2011) This contradiction likely means that there was an error made in the experimental process of our study. In the case of our study, the lurking variable that stunted the red-light plant’s growth was the plastic cover. The cover trapped heat and moisture in, possibly suffocating the plants with the excess heat and water in the soil. Though the red-light plants received enough nutrients and sufficient sunlight, but likely had their growth stunted by this extra water. In future experiments the red plastic should be kept well above the plants and the controll should have a layer of clear plastic above it as well to avoid this problem. Based on the results, it can be inferred that buckwheat plant’s resource allocation is unaffected by red-light. Future experiments should test other colors as well discover if they have an effect on buckwheat’s resource allocation.
